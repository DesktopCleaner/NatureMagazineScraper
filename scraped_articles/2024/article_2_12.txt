*** A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled1,2,3,4. Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process5,6,7,8,9,10, we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.

*** A central but understudied question in biology is how different macromolecular processes functionally cooperate. In bacteria, transcription performed by RNA polymerase (RNAP) and translation performed by the ribosome occur in the same cellular compartment, which enables functional coupling of these two processes1,2,3,4. Such coupling provides opportunities for regulation that have been shown to make transcription more efficient in the presence of active translation. For example, a ribosome closely trailing behind RNAP inhibits Rho-dependent transcription termination by blocking access to the Rho helicase3. In vitro, a closely trailing ribosome can also prevent RNAP pausing by suppressing hairpin-stabilized pause formation, or rescue paused RNAPs from backtracking by ribosome–RNAP collisions10,11,12.

*** Transcription and translation rates are also known to be correlated12, raising the question of how elongation speeds in both processes are communicated between the two macromolecular machineries. One possibility is that communication happens by the alarmone (p)ppGpp, which affects both transcription and translation elongation rates13. Alternatively, direct physical interactions between the RNAP and a closely trailing ribosome could allow coordinating elongation rates10,11,12. Indeed, several studies, including recent high-resolution structures, demonstrate a physical link that establishes coupling between both machineries (termed expressome in this study) that is either mediated by direct interactions between the RNAP and the ribosome or by factor-mediated interactions mainly via the transcription factors NusG and/or NusA5,6,7,8,9,10. Those structures broadly fall into one of three categories: collided, coupled and uncoupled. The collided state, which contains the shortest possible intervening mRNA spacer between ribosome and RNAP, allows neither NusA binding nor NusG-based bridging and potentially lacks the ω subunit of the RNAP6,7. Furthermore, it could not be captured in vivo under normal growth conditions and could be isolated only when the cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor pseudouridimycin, artificially stalling the RNAP8. This raises the question of whether ribosome–RNAP collisions, whereby the ribosome pushes the RNAP forwards as recently suggested9,10,11, provide the prevalent mechanism for reactivating paused RNAPs in vivo. By contrast, the coupled state is compatible with known functional aspects of transcription and translation and NusA–NusG bridging, and therefore could provide a functional state during which communication between both machineries could occur. However, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) structures only provide structural snapshots of a dynamic process and do not allow direct monitoring of activity. They also do not provide information on whether physical coupling can occur only when the two machineries are close along the mRNA sequence or whether coupling could also occur via mRNA looping.

*** Here we reconstitute the complete active transcription–translation coupling system in vitro. We investigate the molecular mechanism of transcription–translation coupling by combining bulk biochemical experiments with multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy assays to place various published structural snapshots along a reaction path. By simultaneously tracking transcription and translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between both machineries, we find that the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP, providing a biophysical explanation for why the collided state has so far not been detected in vivo and may only occur as an infrequent state—for example, when RNAP is stalled on a DNA lesion14. We see that physical coupling can occur during active transcription elongation, by looping-out of the mRNA. This physical coupling allows the ribosome to activate a stalled RNAP by long-range communication, without the need for collisions, and provides an explanation for how the central machineries in gene expression coordinate their activities.

*** To directly visualize the process of transcription–translation coupling in real time, we reconstituted a complete and active in vitro transcription–translation system. We established single-molecule fluorescence microscopy assays that enable us to simultaneously track transcription and translation elongation occurring on the same nascent mRNA. To this end, we prepared a stalled transcription elongation complex (TEC) (Fig.1aandMethods) consisting of a 3′-2×Cy3.5-labelled DNA template,Escherichia coliRNAP and a nascently transcribed mRNA containing a ribosome-binding site15(RBS). We then loaded a Cy3-labelled 30S ribosomal subunit (labelled at an extension on helix 44 (h44) of the 16S rRNA) in the presence of the initiation factor IF2a and fmet–tRNAfmeton to the nascent mRNA16,17. The resulting translation pre-initiation complex (PIC) was immobilized via the 5′ end of the nascent mRNA to a polyethylene glycol (PEG)–biotin-functionalized glass surface for single-molecule multi-colour imaging.

*** Elongation of both machineries was triggered at the beginning of imaging by addition of NTPs, Cy5-labelled 50S subunit17(labelled at an extension on helix 101 (h101) of the 23S rRNA), elongation factor-G (EF-G), ternary complex (elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu)-aminoacyl-tRNA-GTP) and elongation factor thermo stable (EF-Ts) (Fig.1b). Consistent with previous reports18,19,20,21, subunit joining was observed by the appearance of a Cy3–Cy5 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.1a,b) immediately following the addition of all components (within 3 s for 50% of the molecules at 50 nM Cy5–50S). Translation elongation at single-amino-acid resolution can be monitored by the 30S-h44–50S-h101 FRET pair under our experimental conditions (Methods), which reports on the two main steps of translation elongation—peptidyl transfer and translocation (Fig.1b)—in which the ribosome transitions from a non-rotated, high-FRET state to a rotated, low-FRET state16,17,22. We monitored translation of individual codons over several minutes and reliably quantified the lifetime in the rotated and non-rotated states at up to 500 nM aminoacyl-tRNA (aa–tRNA) and 160 nM EF-G concentrations (Extended Data Fig.1g) with values one order of magnitude lower than in vivo23,24, but in agreement with previous single-molecule experiments19,25.

*** Simultaneously to translation elongation, we monitored transcription progression by following the DNA template signal. After delivery of all four NTPs, transcription immediately resumes and could be monitored over several minutes. Transcription termination is characterized by a single-step disappearance of the Cy3.5 signal15. Plotting the time from NTP addition until DNA template dissociation for individual molecules allowed us to calculate average transcription rates (Extended Data Fig.1g), which are NTP concentration dependent and are in agreement with previous bulk in vitro transcription and single-molecule studies, as well as in vivo rates12,15,26,27. Overall, our combined in vitro reconstituted transcription–translation system recapitulates the activities of each system previously studied in isolation.

*** The full control of all components in our single-molecule assays enables us to compare the translation elongation kinetics of single ribosomes translating either unhindered on an mRNA (if the RNAP transcribes faster than the ribosome translates the mRNA) or in the presence of a paused RNAP leading to a collision between the ribosome and the RNAP. We used a DNA template that allowed us to stall the ribosome and the RNAP with 46 nucleotides (nt) between the ribosome P-site to the RNAP active site (Fig.2a, Supplementary Tables1and2and Methods). This state was previously structurally characterized and classified as a ‘coupled state TTC-B’7(Fig.2g). On the basis of the cryo-EM structures, this coupled state allows the translation of two to three amino acids until both machineries substantially assume a ‘collided state’ and maximally six amino acids until no intervening mRNA separates both machineries6,7,11(TTC-A, 28 nt separating P-site and RNAP active site; Fig.2g). Delivery of all translation elongation factors together with NTPs triggered simultaneous translocation of both machineries (Fig.2b). The actively transcribed mRNA was also being translated and we were able to track translation of up to 31 codons until the stop codon was reached (Fig.2d).

*** To investigate the effect of a stalled RNAP on ribosome translocation, we next repeated the experiment without delivery of NTPs (Fig.2c). As expected, withholding NTPs during the single-molecule experiment led to collision of the ribosome into the artificially paused RNAP. Under these conditions, the largest fraction of ribosomes (79%) completed 4 to 6 translation cycles before the end of the experiment or before photobleaching occurred (Fig.2d). Comparing the median dwell times for translation of the individual codons of unhindered ribosomes with ribosomes that are in the process of colliding with the RNAP showed that the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP (Fig.2e, compare blue with orange data). The non-rotated and rotated state dwell times gradually increase once the ribosome gets to five to six amino acids away from the stalled RNAP (Fig.2eand Extended Data Fig.2a–c). In the absence of a stalled RNAP, the dwell times for the non-rotated state (rate-limited by aa–tRNA arrival) or rotated state (rate-limited by EF-G arrival) can be fitted to a single-exponential function in agreement with a single rate-limiting step28(Extended Data Fig.2a). By contrast, under colliding conditions, the dwell times no longer follow single-exponential kinetic behaviour, suggesting additional rate-limiting steps while transitioning (Fig.2g) from coupled to collided state (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.2a–c). By increasing the aa–tRNA and EF-G concentrations tenfold during colliding conditions, ribosome slowdown is not substantially affected (Extended Data Fig.2d), suggesting that the physical basis for slowdown is not due to steric interference affecting the delivery of aa–tRNA and/or EF-G but due to the increased mechanical force required to perform a translation cycle10while structurally being in or transiently visiting the collided state6,7. Finally, we observe that under colliding conditions (Extended Data Figs.1h,iand2e), the ribosome preferentially ends up in the rotated state (50 ± 2% of molecules compared with 17 ± 5% for elongating conditions), similarly to what has been found in vivo for a pseudouridimycin stalled expressome8.

*** Available cryo-EM structures represent either collided states or coupled states up to an intervening mRNA length of 47 nt between the ribosome P-site and RNAP active site (6 amino acids inter-translation distance; Fig.2g, left structure). Structures with longer intervening mRNA have so far not been obtained in vitro6,7,9. Furthermore, cryo-ET structures obtained from active expressomes in vivo did not show any density for the intervening mRNA8. This raises the question of whether the ribosome and the RNAP can also physically couple if their intervening mRNA length is longer than can be visualized by current methods, and what the kinetics and function of such coupling–uncoupling interactions would be.

*** To this end, we developed single-molecule assays to directly track in real time the coupling and uncoupling dynamics between a stalled RNAP and a stalled ribosome at various lengths of intervening mRNA between both machineries (46–457 nt between P-site and RNAP active site; hereafter called mRNA-46 to mRNA-457; Fig.3a). We labelled the ribosome and the RNAP with a donor and acceptor dye, such that FRET is only observed if both machineries are in a coupled state (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.3). The ribosome was labelled at its mRNA-entry channel (rRNA extension at helix 33a (h33a)16,29) with a donor Cy3 dye and the RNAP at the N terminus or C terminus of the β′ subunit with an acceptor Cy5 dye using ybbR-tag-mediated dye coupling30,31(Methods). Labelling both the ribosome16,17,25and the RNAP (Extended Data Fig.3b) at these positions did not detectably affect activity, and results in an inter-dye distance of 34–57 Å if the RNAP and the ribosome are in a coupled state (Extended Data Fig.3a).

*** After immobilizing the pre-assembled expressomes on a microscope slide (Methods), we used alternating-laser excitation32(ALEX) at wavelengths of 532 and 638 nm (Fig.3d,e) to distinguish uncoupling events from photobleaching (Methods). By plotting the FRET efficiency distributions, we could describe the inter-ribosome–RNAP distance distribution for the ensemble of the expressome molecules. We observe a gradual shift of the FRET efficiency distribution towards smaller values in agreement with increasing RNAP–ribosome separation when increasing intervening mRNA length (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.4a). For mRNA-46, we find two well-defined peaks, which we assign to uncoupled and coupled expressomes, in agreement with the reported cryo-EM structures6,7(Extended Data Fig.3). By contrast, for mRNA-85, we observe a broadening of the distribution, which shifts towards a single peak with FRET efficiency (EFRET) ≈ 0 for the longest mRNA-457. While hidden Markov modelling (HMM) enables the assignment of various states (three states predicted;Methods), dozens of different cryo-EM structures were determined describing a broad structural distribution of coupled expressomes6,7(Extended Data Fig.3c,dand Source Data), including additional loosely coupled states (TTC-LC) detected with intervening mRNA sequences longer than 50 nucleotides33. Therefore, unambiguous detection and assignment of the various structural states to specificEFRETvalues is not possible. However, taking the available structural knowledge into account, we can classify our data into three broad classes: uncoupled complexes (EFRET= 0); loosely coupled expressome complexes TTC-LC33(EFRET≈ 0.1); and coupled expressomes in state TTC-B6,7(EFRET≈ 0.3). Targeted hybridization of DNA oligonucleotides to the intervening mRNA results in an increase in the inter-ribosome–RNA distance distribution for mRNA-46 and a complete loss of coupling for mRNA-85 and the longer mRNAs (Extended Data Fig.4b–d) further validating our assignment. Using this classification, we plotted the fraction of coupled states (both TTC-B and TTC-LC) as a function of the intervening mRNA length and find that the fraction of coupled expressomes decreases from 65 ± 4% for mRNA-46 to 8 ± 1% for mRNA-457 (Fig.3cand Extended Data Fig.5b).

*** Next, we determined how long the expressomes remain coupled. For mRNA-46, all the molecules remain coupled until photobleaching, with a lower bound of 150 ± 5 s for the median coupled lifetime (Extended Data Fig.5c). This is in agreement with the formation of stable complexes observed in the cryo-EM structures6,7and would enable a ribosome–RNAP complex to remain coupled during transcription of a completeE. coligene. For the longer intervening mRNA lengths, the majority of the expressomes also remain coupled till photobleaching (Extended Data Fig.5c,e–h). A small fraction of expressomes show uncoupling and recoupling (Extended Data Fig.5a). with recoupling becoming slower with increasing intervening mRNA lengths, taking in average 10.1 ± 1.4 s and 24.3 ± 5 s to recouple for the mRNA-85 and mRNA-193 constructs, respectively (Extended Data Fig.5d–h).

*** Overall, these experiments demonstrate that ribosome and RNAP can physically interact even if the ribosome does not closely trail behind the RNAP and that the expressomes become less compact and decrease in physical coupling efficiency with increasing intervening mRNA length.

*** The transcription factor NusG is responsible for bridging the ribosome with the RNAP5,34,35,36,37and restrains RNAP motions6. By contrast, only a single NusA-only bound expressome structure was obtained at low resolution at a short intervening mRNA sequence of 39 nt, suggesting loosening of the expressome structure7. We repeated our coupling experiments for mRNA-85 in the presence of either one or both Nus factors. Our data show that in the presence of NusG, irrespective of NusA, theEFRETvalue of the coupled state increases in agreement with compaction of the expressome (Fig.3gand Extended Data Fig.4e). By contrast, addition of NusA alone resulted in a loosening of the expressome structure. Overall, these findings illustrate how the two transcription factors NusA and NusG modulate expressome compaction and are in agreement with NusG being the main driver of expressome stability.

*** Next, we investigated the effect of transcription elongation on the coupling efficiency. To this end, we immobilized expressomes with 46 nt intervening mRNA sequence and containing Cy5–RNAP, Cy3–30S and the 3′ end of the DNA template labelled with 2×Cy3.5. Under these conditions, 78% of the molecules showed a Cy3–Cy5 FRET signal at the start of the experiment, characteristic for the presence of coupled complexes (Fig.4aand Extended Data Figs.3a,6cand7a–c). After starting single-molecule imaging, we added NTPs to initiate transcription elongation, but kept the ribosome stalled at the RBS by not adding translation elongation factors. Under these conditions transcription immediately resumes (Extended Data Figs.8and9). In total, 37% of the traces showed a 30S–Cy3 to RNAP–Cy5 FRET signal until the end of transcription without any uncoupling or recoupling events (Fig.4dand Extended Data Figs.6cand7a), demonstrating constant coupling between ribosome and RNAP during active transcription elongation. However, for the remaining 63% of the molecules, the RNAP–Cy5 signal photobleached before the end of transcription (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.7b,c), allowing us to only provide a lower estimate of approximately 60 s for the median coupled lifetime during active transcription elongation (Fig.4c). Of note, for a fraction of the traces (42 ± 1%; Fig.4f), a FRET signal between 30S–Cy3 and DNA–Cy3.5 appeared at the end of the 156-nucleotide mRNA transcription (Fig.4a). This FRET, for which both dyes are not affected by photobleaching under our experimental conditions, shows that the ribosome is positioned close to the end of the DNA template, a configuration that can only be achieved when the two machineries are coupled at the end of transcription (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.3d). Using this Cy3–Cy3.5 FRET signal as a proxy for coupling once the full-length mRNA has been transcribed (156 nucleotides intervening mRNA sequence), we next compared the effect of the different Nus factors on coupling efficiency. We find that in the presence of NusG, and largely independent of NusA, the fraction of molecules that are coupled at the end of transcription is approximately twofold higher, reaching around 80% in the presence of both factors (Fig.4f). By contrast, NusG(NTD)38or NusG(F165A)34, two mutants that can interact only with the RNAP, show no increase in functional coupling (Fig.4f) but retain their ability to increase the transcription rate (Extended Data Fig.10b,c). That the coupling is mainly maintained by NusG is in agreement with a highly conserved NusG–ribosome interaction surface in contrast to the poor NusA–ribosome interface conservation6,7,8,39. Overall, our data show that RNAP and ribosome can remain physically coupled during active transcription elongation, with hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA looping-out in between, and that the coupling efficiency is increased by transcription factor NusG, in agreement with previous findings that NusG is important for transcription–translation coupling5,34,35,36,37.

*** Next, we explored whether ribosome–RNAP collisions may influence the subsequent coupling efficiency. To this end, we immobilized a collided expressome (RNAP–Cy5, 30S–Cy3) to the imaging surface. In contrast to the coupled expressome, the collided expressome shows no FRET between RNAP–Cy5 and 30S-h33a–Cy3 (>100 Å between the two dyes; Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.3a). We triggered transcription elongation of the RNAP by delivering NTPs (Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.6b). Transcription from the collided state immediately resumes after addition of all four NTPs (stalled TEC band completely chased in <10 s; see Extended Data Fig.8), in agreement with previous studies11. As transcription proceeds and the RNAP transitions from being collided to being coupled with the ribosome, a Cy3–Cy5 FRET signal appears (Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.7d). Remarkably, coupling following a collision is more than tenfold shorter-lived compared with coupling in the absence of a prior collision (Fig.4c). The coupled lifetime reduces to only 7.8 ± 0.8 s (Extended Data Fig.6a) with the RNAP and the ribosome dynamically coupling and uncoupling multiple times during subsequent transcription elongation (Fig.4c,dand Extended Data Fig.6b). The fraction of traces that show coupled transcription–translation complexes at the end of transcription reduces to 4.9 ± 1.5% (versus 41.4 ± 0.5% without prior ribosome–RNAP collision; compare Fig.4ewith Fig.4f) and increases to 14 ± 3 or 36 ± 1% in the presence of NusG or both Nus factors, respectively (compared to 68 ± 4/76 ± 6% without prior ribosome–RNAP collision). Overall, this demonstrates that RNAP–ribosome collisions reduce subsequent coupling efficiency. We hypothesize that the more transient nature of coupling following a ribosome–RNAP collision may be attributed to a structural or compositional change of the ribosome–RNAP interface after collision—for example, the loss of the omega subunit from RNAP—as suggested by the missing electron density in the cryo-EM maps of the collided state6,7.

*** Having demonstrated that the ribosome and the RNAP can also physically couple with long intervening mRNA raised the question of whether this long-range physical coupling can be also functional. In other words, whether the ribosome can also activate a stalled RNAP by long-range coupling interactions.

*** To address this, we immobilized stalled TECs either in the absence of a ribosome or in the presence of a ribosome in a coupled state with 46 nucleotides of intervening mRNA. We started the single-molecule imaging reactions with the addition of NTPs and measured the time it takes to transcribe full-length mRNA molecules (Fig.5a,b). In line with previous bulk experiments40,41,42, our single-molecule data (Fig.5cand Extended Data Fig.10a) and bulk in vitro transcription reactions (Extended Data Fig.9) show a significant effect of NusA and NusG on transcription pausing or transcription activation, respectively, demonstrating the activity of the Nus factors on transcription elongation. In the absence of Nus factors (median transcription time: 69.2 ± 1.9 s (−70S) versus 62.4 ± 4 s (+70S); 1.1-fold decrease), with NusG alone (45.8 ± 4.8 s (−70S) versus 50.5 ± 11.0 s (+70S); 0.9-fold), or with both Nus factors (120.2 ± 5.9 s (−70S) versus 86.6 ± 1.6 s (+70S); 1.4-fold decrease), we see only marginal ribosome-induced acceleration of transcription speed. However, with NusA alone (205.5 ± 0.5 s (−70S) versus 100.6 ± 10.3 s (+70S); twofold decrease), transcription is significantly faster in the presence of the ribosome, indicating that a coupled ribosome can rescue a NusA-paused RNAP.

*** To verify the results of our single-molecule experiments, we performed bulk in vitro transcription assays. For this purpose, we purified the expressome (formed with mRNA-46) using streptavidin beads by immobilizing via biotin-labelled 50S subunits. This enabled us to enrich fully assembled expressomes in our transcription assays (Methods). Although there is only a slight increase in transcription speed for most conditions (without factors, NusG or NusA and NusG) in the presence of the ribosome (Extended Data Fig.9a–e,g), once again there is a significantly larger ribosome-induced increase in transcription efficiency in the presence of NusA alone (Fig.5eand Extended Data Fig.9a–e,g). We find two prominent pause sites for mRNA-46 that are most probably induced by formation of pause hairpins43(Extended Data Fig.9h). Notably, these transcription assays enable us to determine pause-escape lifetimes in the presence and absence of the ribosome and the intervening mRNA distance between ribosome and RNAP at which the ribosome-accelerated pause release occurs (Methods). We find that at the first pause site (at 134 nt, 71 nt intervening mRNA), the ribosome decreases the pause-escape lifetime 1.1-fold from 66 ± 3 s to 60 ± 14 s in the presence of NusA (Extended Data Fig.9e). At the second pause site (at 169 nt, 106 nt intervening mRNA) we observe a stronger effect (ribosome decreases the pause-escape lifetime 2.2-fold from 182 ± 9 s to 84 ± 17 s). Repeating our experiments by adding an mRNA-assembled ribosome to our actively transcribing RNAPs intrans, we find no ribosome-induced activation (Extended Data Fig.9f), supporting the requirement for a shared mRNA between the two machineries for functional activation.

*** Structurally, both NusA-mediated RNAP pausing44and NusA-associated coupling in the expressome have been described7. The superposition of the two structures shows that the NusA conformation differs substantially between the expressome and NusA-bound RNAP structures and that the NusA pause-promoting conformation cannot occur in the coupled expressome because NusA would clash with the 30S ribosomal subunit (Fig.5d). Overall, our data are consistent with a model in which long-range coupling between the ribosome and a NusA-mediated paused RNAP prevents NusA from assuming a pause-promoting conformation, thereby activating transcription.

*** Transcription–translation coupling has served as a paradigm on how macromolecular machines can cooperate inside cells. Here, using in vitro reconstitution of the complete active transcription–translation machinery and using multi-colour single-molecule imaging, we have simultaneously tracked transcription and translation elongation, together with the physical and functional coupling between both machineries. Decades of work and recent cryo-EM and cryo-ET structures of the expressome suggest that transcription–translation coupling is general1,5,6,7,8,9,12,36,45, but recent data also suggest that coupling is more stochastic inE. coli46,47or that the two processes are mostly decoupled48. Our work consolidates both models, as we show that physical and functional coupling can also occur efficiently when both machineries are far apart along the mRNA sequence, by looping of the mRNA (Fig.5f). Our new model has several major implications for the field and beyond.

*** The functional relevance of the collided state is debated7,36,37. It was structurally characterized by several independent groups6,7,8,9,10but failure to detect this state in vivo in the absence of antibiotics8was interpreted as evidence that the collisions are transient37. However, it was also argued that these collisions are non-physiological7. Ribosome–RNAP collisions are a possible in vitro mechanism for the ribosome to rescue a backtracked RNAP10,11,12,14, but functionally only at a separation of 28 to 29 nucleotides of intervening mRNA between RNAP active site and ribosome P-site10,14. Structural studies demonstrate that a substantial fraction of the expressomes adopt a collided conformation at a distance of 37 nucleotides or less6,7and our data show that the ribosome begins to slow down at an intervening mRNA distance at which the expressome preferentially adopts a collided conformation. We therefore postulate that functional collisions, which occur with 28 to 29 nucleotides of intervening mRNA, are probably infrequent events, but are relevant, for example, for rescue of arrested backtracked RNAPs or for selective destruction of non-functional transcription complexes stalled on DNA lesions14. Instead, more efficient ribosome-induced RNAP activation from NusA-dependent hairpin-stabilized pausing via long-range coupling can occur during the entire transcription process, with several hundred nucleotides of separation, and is therefore relevant for an averageE. colimRNA length of 1,000 nucleotides49. Long-range physical coupling may also occur between the RNAP and a non-leading ribosome. Such a mechanism would provide a means for the RNAP to sense the ribosome loading occupancy on the mRNA rather than just the physical proximity of the leading ribosome, because a larger number of ribosomes on the nascent mRNA would provide more chances for long-range RNAP–ribosome encounters and thereby increase the probability for RNAP activation.

*** We show that the mRNA can form loops containing several hundred nucleotides and that coupling remains stable during active transcription, further supported by NusG and NusA. This requires rethinking our understanding of how the ribosome modulates Rho-dependent transcription termination50,51. In a model in which the mRNA can loop out by more than 100 nucleotides, Rho could also engage with the mRNA (Rho–mRNA footprint of 57–85 nucleotides52) at the same time that the RNAP and the ribosome are physically coupled. Whether Rho could push the ribosome away in order to reach the RNAP for terminating transcription and how this is coordinated with NusG, which can bind either Rho or the ribosome with its C-terminal domain50, remains to be investigated.

*** Co-transcriptional RNA looping is likely to be a more general feature for increasing the efficiency of transcription-coupled processes53. For example, in bacterial rRNA transcription (mediated by interactions between the ribosomal RNA transcription antitermination complex and the RNAP54) and eukaryotic co-transcriptional splicing (mediated by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)–RNA polymerase II interactions55) transcription-mediated RNA looping could provide means for increased RNA processing efficiency (RNase III processing and splicing, respectively).

*** Overall, our work underlines the importance of studying biological processes not in isolation but in the context of their functionally coupled system and highlights the power of multi-colour single-molecule experiments for tracking the dynamics of complex interconnected multi-step processes at high spatiotemporal resolution.

*** Ribosome mutant SQ380 strains (B68 strain, 30S helical extension in h33a; C68 strain, 30S helical extension in h44; and ZS22 strain, 50S helical extension in h101) and all plasmids for initiation and elongation factors were a gift from the Puglisi laboratory16,17. The plasmid for overexpressing initiator tRNAfmet(pBStRNAfmetY2) was a gift from E. Schmitt56. The plasmids forE. coliRNAP (pVS10) and σ70 (pIA586) were purchased from Addgene (#104398 and #104399, respectively)57. The ybbR peptide tag (DSLEFIASKLA)58,59was cloned into the pVS10 plasmid by introducing the ybbR DNA sequence with primers, followed by 5′-end phosphorylation with T4 PNK (New England Biolabs, NEB) and simultaneous blunt ligation of the plasmid using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). For the N-terminal ybbR mutant, the tag was inserted between E15 and E16 in the β′ subunit; for the C-terminal β′ mutant, it was inserted between E1377 and G1402, thereby deleting the region A1378–L1401. Gene sequences of ribosomal protein S1, NusA, NusG, NusG(NTD) (M1–P124), NusG(F165A), methionyl-tRNAfmetformyltransferase (MTF) and methionine tRNA synthetase (MetRS, truncated at K548 to obtain the monomeric form of the enzyme60) were cloned into a pESUMO vector backbone using Gibson assembly. Gene sequences were obtained from ASKA collection plasmids61.

*** E. coliribosomal subunits, initiation factor IF2 and elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-G and EF-Ts) were prepared and purified as previously described16,17. Wild-type RNAP and mutant versions were purified as described57. Initiator tRNAfmetwas prepared and purified following the protocol as described62. S1, NusA, NusG and NusG mutants were overexpressed as N-terminal fusions with His6–SUMO. They were purified by lysing the cells in IMAC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10–20 mM imidazole, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) using a microfluidizer, loading the clarified lysate on 5 ml HisTrap HP columns (Cytiva) and eluting with increasing imidazole concentrations over 20 column volumes. Protein fractions were pooled and the fusion tag was cleaved overnight with His-tagged Ulp1 protease, while dialysing against IMAC buffer without imidazole. The cleaved tag was removed by a second HisTrap purification. Protein fractions were pooled, concentrated using 15 ml Amicon Ultracel 10 or 30 K concentrators and further purified via size exclusion chromatography using either HiLoad S75 (NusG/NusG(NTD)/NusG(F165A)) or HiLoad S200 (NusA, S1) columns (Cytiva) equilibrated with storage buffer (S1 in 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and NusA, NusG or NusG mutants in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA/DTT). Protein fractions were pooled and concentrated using 15 ml Amicon Ultracel 10 or 30 K concentrators to ~100 µM. Aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. In the case of MTF and MetRS, the preparation was done as described above with following changes (and adapted from refs.62,63): (1) MTF IMAC buffer contained 10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4pH 7.3, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; MetRS buffer contained 10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4pH 6.7, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 100 µM ZnCl2and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. (2) After a second HisTrap purification, MetRS containing fractions were pooled and dialysed against storage buffer (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4pH 6.7, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50% (v/v) glycerol). Aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. (3) After a second HisTrap purification, MTF was further purified via a 5 ml HiTrap Q FF column (Cytiva) and eluted using a linear gradient of 20–100% into Q-sepharose buffer (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4pH 7.3, 500 mM KCl and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein fractions were pooled and dialysed against storage buffer (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4pH 6.7, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50% (v/v) glycerol). Aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. An SDS–PAGE gel of all protein factors used in this manuscript is included in Extended Data Fig.1j. All uncropped gels are presented in Supplementary Fig.1.

*** Typically, initiator tRNAfmet(20 µM) was simultaneously charged and formylated in 800 µl reactions using 100 µM methionine, 300 µM 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, 200 nM MetRS and 500 nM MTF in charging buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT), incubating for 5 min at 37 °C (refs.62,64). The fmet–tRNAfmetwas immediately purified by addition of 0.1 volumes of sodium acetate (pH 5.2), extraction with aqueous phenol (pH ~ 4) and precipitation with 3 volumes of ethanol. The tRNA pellet was solubilized in ice-cold tRNA storage buffer (10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 0.5 mM MgCl2) and further purified with a Nap-5 column (Cytiva) equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluate was aliquoted, flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Elongator tRNAs were purchased (tRNA MRE600, Roche) and charged typically at 500 µM concentration in the presence of 0.2 mM amino acid mix (each), 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 20% (v/v) S150 extract (prepared following ref.65), 0.05 mg ml−1pyruvate kinase (Roche) and 0.2 U µl−1thermostable inorganic pyrophosphatase (NEB) in total tRNA charging buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)29. Typically, 200 µl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then immediately purified as described above. To remove NTP contaminations introduced by the S150 extract, the aa–tRNAs were further purified over a S200 increase column (Cytiva), pre-equilibrated in tRNA storage buffer. The eluted fractions were combined, concentrated with 2 ml Amicon Ultracel 3K concentrators, aliquoted and flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Charging efficiency (typically >90%) was verified with acidic urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described64.

*** Hairpin loop extensions of mutant ribosomal subunits were labelled with prNQ087–Cy3 or prNQ159–Cy3B (30S) and prNQ088–Cy5 (50S) DNA oligonucleotides, complementary to mutant helical extensions16,17,19(see Supplementary Table3for all DNA and RNA oligonucleotide sequences). Just prior to the experiments, each subunit was labelled separately at 2 µM concentration using 1.2 equivalents of the respective DNA oligonucleotide by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min and then at 30 °C for 20 min in a Tris-based polymix buffer (50 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM ammonium acetate, 0.5 mM calcium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM putrescine-HCl and 1 mM spermidine). RNAP–ybbR mutants (core enzyme) were labelled by mixing 7 µM RNAP, 14 µM SFP synthetase and 28 µM CoA-Cy5 dye in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT and 10% (v/v) glycerol66. Typically, 100 µl reactions were incubated at 25 °C or 37 °C for 2 h and analysed on denaturing protein gels. The holoenzyme was formed by incubating 1.11 µM Cy5-labelled RNAP with 3 equivalents σ70 for 30 min on ice in RNAP storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol). Aliquots were stored at −20 °C. SFP and free dye were removed on imaging surface prior to experiments.

*** DNA templates were purchased (TwistBioscience) and amplified via PCR using p0030 forward and p0075 reverse abasic primers, generating single-stranded 5′ overhangs for both DNA strands15. The fragments were purified on 2% agarose gels, extracted using a QIAGEN gel extraction kit and buffer exchanged in e55 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 20 mM KCl) using 0.5 ml Amicon Ultracel 30 K concentrators. The 5′ overhang of the template DNA was hybridized by mixing with 1.2 equivalents of p0088–2×Cy3.5 DNA oligonucleotide at 68 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cool down (~1 h) to room temperature.

*** Stalled TECs were assembled in transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM NaCl, 14 mM MgCl2, 0.04 mM EDTA, 40 µg ml−1non-acylated BSA, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mM DTT) as described previously15,67. In brief, 50 nM DNA template was incubated (20 min, 37 °C) with four equivalents of RNAP in the presence of 100 µM ACU trinucleotide, 5 µM GTP, 5 µM ATP (+150–300 nM32P α-ATP, Hartmann Analytic), halting the polymerase at U24, to prevent loading of multiple RNAPs on the same DNA template. Next, re-initiation of transcription was blocked by addition of 10 µg ml−1rifampicin. The RNAP was walked to the desired stalling site by addition of 10 µM UTP and incubating at 37 °C for 20 min. The 30S ribosomal subunit was loaded for 10 min at 37 °C by incubating 25 nM stalled TEC with 250 nM 30S (B68 mutant, pre-incubated with stoichiometric amounts of S1 protein for 5 min at 37 °C) in the presence of 2 µM IF2, 1 µM fmet–tRNAfmetand 4 mM GTP in polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate. To enrich for fully assembled ribosome–RNAP complexes, the expressome was purified via immobilizing the 50S subunit (ZS22) onto streptavidin magnetic beads (NEB). For this, the 50S subunit was pre-annealed on h101 with prNQ302-prNQ303-prNQ304-p0109–biotin–DNA oligonucleotide. The prNQ303 and prNQ304 DNA oligonucleotides contain a BamHI cleavage site to elute the purified ribosome–RNAP complex from streptavidin beads. 50S loading onto the stalled TEC/30S PIC occurred simultaneously while immobilizing the ribosome–RNAP complex on streptavidin magnetic beads (pre-equilibrated with polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate) for 10 min at room temperature. Typically, 50 µl beads were loaded with a total volume of 150 µl ribosome–RNAP complex. The immobilized complex was washed once with polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate and then eluted with 100 µl polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate, while cleaving with BamHI for 20 min at 37 °C. The eluate was chased with 50 µM NTPs in the presence or absence of Nus factors (at 1 µM each, when present), 4 mM GTP, polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate and 100 mM potassium glutamate. Time points were taken before NTP addition (t= 0 s) and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360 and 600 s for each condition, mixing 2.5 µl sample with 5 µl stop buffer (7 M urea, 2× TBE, 50 mM EDTA, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene blue) and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. Single-round transcription assays with 70S intranswere performed as described above with minor changes. Ribosomal subunits were loaded at 1 µM concentration on 8 µM 6(FK) mRNA17to ensure that 70S PIC formation was complete. Stalled TEC was added, and the reaction was chased with 50 µM NTPs (each) in the presence of 1 µM NusA, having final concentrations of 350 nM 70S PIC and 6.25 nM stalled TEC. As size reference, the ssRNA ladder (NEB, sizes: 50, 80, 150, 300, 500 and 1,000 nt) was 5′ end labelled with32P γ-ATP. The reactions were analysed on 6% denaturing PAGE (7 M urea in 1× TBE), running in 1× TBE and 50 W for 2–3 h. Gels were dried, exposed overnight on a phosphor screen (Cytiva, BAS IP MS 2040 E) and imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500. Band intensities (P) were integrated using ImageLab 6.1 software (Bio-Rad) and divided by the total RNA per lane (T) to compensate for pipetting errors, as described68. Normalized band intensities (P/T) were plotted as function of time. Pause-escape lifetimes were fitted as described68by plotting ln(P/T) against time and fitting the pause-escape data range (indicated in plots) with a linear equation (y=mx+b, withmbeing the pause-escape rate). All uncropped gels are presented in Supplementary Fig.1.

*** Stalled TECs were formed as described for single-round transcription assays with following changes: (1) Typically, labelled DNA was used (pre-annealed with p0088–2×Cy3.5). (2) Stalled transcription was performed in the presence of 10 µM ATP and 10 µM GTP. (3) Re-initiation of transcription was blocked with 1 mg ml−1heparin (final concentration). (4) For immobilization, the 5′ end of the nascent mRNA was labelled with a biotin–DNA oligonucleotide (prNQ127-p0109–biotin). (5) When necessary, Cy5-labelled RNAP was used (N-terminal ybbR tag or C-terminal ybbR tag). Typically, ribosomes (250 nM 30S, 500 nM 50S) were loaded for 5 min at 37 °C by incubating 4 nM stalled TEC in the presence of 2 µM IF2, 1 µM fmet–tRNAfmetand 4 mM GTP in polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate. The loading reaction was diluted to 100–800 pM stalled TEC concentration (DNA template-based) with an IF2-containing (2 µM) polymix buffer at 15 mM magnesium acetate and immobilized on biotin–PEG functionalized slides coated with NeutrAvidin for 10 min at room temperature69. Unbound components were washed away with an IF2-containing (2 µM) imaging buffer (polymix buffer with 15 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium glutamate) and imaging was immediately started. The imaging buffer was supplemented with an oxygen scavenger system (OSC), containing 2.5 mM protocatechuic acid and 190 nM protocatechuate dioxygenase and a cocktail of triplet state quenchers (1 mM 4-citrobenzyl alcohol, 1 mM cyclooctatetraene and 1 mM trolox) to minimize fluorescence instability. For equilibrium experiments, the imaging buffer in addition contained 4 mM GTP and 1 µM Nus factors (each, exact composition indicated in figures). For real-time experiments, the reaction was initiated while imaging (after 10–30 s), with delivery of 50 nM 50S–Cy5 (where applicable), 2 µM IF2, 10–500 nM EF-G (where applicable, in specified concentrations, typically 50 nM), 100–1500 nM ternary complex (where applicable, in specified concentrations, typically 150 nM), 10–1,000 µM NTPs (each, where applicable, in specified concentrations) and 1 µM Nus factors (each, where applicable) in the same imaging buffer containing additional 4 mM GTP. The ternary complex was prepared as described previously70,71. For 2-colour translation experiments, a second delivery mix was injected containing 10% of the initial OSC (in imaging buffer) to actively induce photobleaching after 20 min of movie acquisition.

*** Spontaneous intersubunit rotations can complicate analysis and assignment of real translation transitions22. Therefore, we chose experimental conditions in which we can minimize the interference from spontaneous intersubunit rotations. We are using polymix buffer, which was shown by the most recent study by Ermolenko and colleagues22to reduce the fraction of ribosomes showing spontaneous fluctuations by 20-fold with only 1% of the h44–Cy3/H101–Cy5 ribosomes showing spontaneous fluctuations22. Furthermore, we chose slower translation conditions in which the timescale of the spontaneous intersubunit rotations is faster (0.3–2 s−1; see ref.22) and not even all spontaneous fluctuations may be detected at our frametime of 200 ms. The difference in timescales between real translations and intersubunit fluctuations is especially pronounced during ribosome slowdown for which the timescale of translation and spontaneous intersubunit rotations can differ by two orders of magnitude.

*** We performed all single-molecule experiments at 21 °C using a custom-built (by Cairn Research:https://www.cairn-research.co.uk/), objective-based (CFI SR HP Apochromat TIRF 100×C Oil) total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope, equipped with an iLAS system (Cairn Research) and Prime95B sCMOS cameras (Teledyne Photometrics). For standard TIRF experiments (2 or 3 colours), we used a diode-based (OBIS) 532 nm laser at 0.6 kW cm−2intensity (on the basis of output power). The fluorescence intensities of Cy3, Cy3.5 and Cy5 dyes were recorded at exposure times of 200 or 300 ms. For alternative laser excitation32(ALEX) experiments, we operated the 532 nm laser at 0.73 kW cm−2intensity and in every alternate frame, illuminated the samples with a diode-based 638 nm laser (Omicron LuxX) at 0.12 kW cm−2intensity (200 ms exposure time for each laser, resulting in a frame rate of approximately 2 frames per second). Typically, 10 min movies were recorded. For determination of FRET efficiencies, longer movies (20 min) were acquired to ensure photobleaching of both dyes.

*** Images were acquired using the MetaMorph software package (Molecular Devices) and single-molecule traces were extracted using the SPARTAN software package (v.3.7.0)72. Subsequent analysis was done using the tMAVEN73software (when applicable) and with scripts19,74written in MATLAB R2021a and previous versions (MathWorks). Data evaluation in brief: three-colour data was assigned by thresholding, while two-colour data was assigned by HMM, with both approaches detailed in the following. Data for Fig.2were both recorded as three-colour data (as presented in Fig.2b,c) and also repeated using two-colour data (data presented in Fig.2d–fare combined data from two-colour and three-colour replicates; see Source Data).

*** For two-colour translation experiments (30S–Cy3 or 30S–Cy3B and 50S–Cy5; Fig.2), molecules were selected in SPARTAN that had a single photobleaching step for donor and acceptor dye. Those traces were baseline corrected, corrected for donor emission bleedthrough and the apparent sensitivity of each fluorophore. Subsequently, traces were exported to tMAVEN. The evaluation windows were selected from initial 50S subunit joining until: (a) photobleaching of one of the dyes occurred, (b) one dye entered a dark state; or (c) distorted fluorescence intensities that made further assignment difficult. Transitions were detected and assigned to two states using HMM (composite → vbHMM + Kmeans). For downstream evaluation (Extended Data Fig.1c–f), those assignments were exported to MATLAB. First, HMM assignments were visually inspected and manually corrected for anti-correlated intensity changes of both dyes (real FRET transitions; see top trace in Extended Data Fig.1d). Occasionally, intermediate FRET states were encountered that were corrected to high-FRET states using thresholding. For example, for Cy3B, this manual correction reduced the final average transitions per trace from 14 to 12 for elongating conditions and from 5 to 4 for colliding conditions. Second, traces were corrected for spontaneous subunit fluctuations of the rotated state, encountered especially under colliding conditions (see Extended Data Fig.1e). To distinguish rotated state fluctuations (1–2 s timescale22) from real translations (non-rotated state median (3 replicates) = 12.8 ± 4.5 s, when using 150 nM aa–tRNA) we used dwell times for non-rotated states in elongating conditions as a threshold to cutoff non-translations (see Extended Data Fig.1c–e). For this, we determined the 5% tile of all non-rotated state dwells in elongating conditions. Whenever 2 consecutive non-rotated dwells were encountered that were both shorter than the 5%-tile threshold (2.18/0.936 s; probability for 2 consecutive non-rotated dwells with <5%-tile duration to occur under normal translation conditions is 0.25%), translation count was stopped by putting those 2 dwells and all subsequent non-rotated state HMM intensities to rotated state HMM intensities (see Extended Data Fig.1e, top trace). After that, also very short non-rotated dwells (<1%-tile; 0.936/0.5834 s) were removed. The last translation events in each trace were photobleaching-limited. We kept those in for data evaluation, as they inform on ribosome stalling after collision with the RNAP or after encountering the stop codon.

*** For three-colour translation experiments (30S–Cy3, DNA–Cy3.5 and 50S–Cy5; Fig.2), HMM assignment was not possible, due to spectral bleedthrough between channels (Fig.2b,c; see also Extended Data Fig.7c,d). Therefore, FRET transitions were assigned by use of trace-specific thresholds, selecting only for productive FRET states (high-FRET to low-FRET state or vice versa; Extended Data Figs.1d,eand7c,dand supplementary figure 11 in ref.15). For the box plots shown in Fig.2e, the following numbers of molecules/dwells were used (see also Extended Data Fig.2c). Numbers for the first 6 amino acids (see Source Data for full list) are: elongating, non-rotated state:n= 315, 315, 313, 312, 306 and 296; elongating, rotated state:n= 315, 315, 312, 307, 298 and 283; colliding, non-rotated state:n= 307, 306, 302, 275, 213 and 137; colliding, rotated state:n= 307, 305, 293, 254, 187 and 117. Non-rotated and rotated state dwell times were used to calculate cumulative probability density functions of the observed data (ecdf, MATLAB) which were fitted to single-exponential functions in MATLAB (fit, using non-linear least squares methods). If initial double-exponential fitting of the data yielded a population that was represented less than 10%, the data was classified as following single-exponential kinetic behaviour74.

*** Two-colour equilibrium coupling experiments (Fig.3) were acquired using ALEX. Expressome molecules were first selected for assembled expressomes (30S–Cy3 signal, and direct excitation signal of RNAP–Cy5) using SPARTAN. Next, traces were baseline corrected, corrected for the following: (a) donor emission bleedthrough, (b) direct excitation of the acceptor dye and (c) the apparent sensitivity of each fluorophore. Selected traces were exported to tMAVEN. The evaluation windows were selected to include only times, where the RNAP–Cy5 (direct) signal was alive for at least 100 s. To model the number of FRET states we used HMM (Global → vbConsensus + Model selection). The resulting number of states was used to assign FRET states using vbHMM + Kmeans. Selected evaluation windows and assignments were exported for downstream evaluation. FRET efficiencies were extracted with MATLAB using the evaluation windows and fitted to two or three gaussian distributions (depending on modelled states number) using maximum likelihood parameter estimation in MATLAB. For dwell time analysis, HMM assignments based on tMAVEN were visually inspected in MATLAB and corrected for true anti-correlated behaviour for donor and acceptor dyes. States withEFRET= 0 were assigned to uncoupled and all states withEFRET> 0 (loosely coupled and coupled) binned to a single coupled expressomes state. Recoupling rates were obtained by single-exponential fitting of cumulative dwell time distributions for dwells withEFRET= 0.

*** For three-colour real-time coupling experiments (Fig.4; ribosome stalled on RBS, RNAP chased with NTP), assembled expressome molecules were selected (30S–Cy3 signal, DNA–2×Cy3.5 signal and in the case of ALEX, direct excitation signal of RNAP–Cy5) and assigned by thresholding, due to spectral bleedthrough between channels (see Extended Data Fig.7c,d). When applicable, dwell times for transcription or coupling were extracted. For determination of the fraction of coupled molecules until the end of transcription, we assigned the characteristic signal (30S–Cy3/DNA–2×Cy3.5 FRET) and calculated: fraction coupled = (number of coupled molecules with 30S–DNA FRET)/(total number of expressome molecules).

*** For two- to three-colour transcription data evaluation, only traces with single expressome molecules (containing 30S–Cy3 (if present) and DNA–2×Cy3.5) were used. Transcription times were evaluated by assigning the time after reagent delivery until DNA template dissociation using trace-specific thresholds (Extended Data Fig.7c,d). Average transcription times (Extended Data Fig.1g) were obtained by fitting dwell time distributions to a convolution of a Gaussian (describes transcription) and exponential function (describes RNAP-stalling at the 3′ end before termination)15.

*** For representation, the single-molecule traces were smoothed by zero-phase digital filtering by 3 points using the filtfilt function in matlab, but unsmoothed data was used for data evaluation.

*** Structures were visualized with Pymol (v 2.4) or ChimeraX 1.3. All figures were prepared with MATLAB R2021a, Excel 2016 and Adobe Illustrator.

*** Reported error bars represent the s.d. of replicates as indicated in the figure captions. Errors in dwell time fits represent 95% confidence intervals obtained from fits to single-exponential functions as indicated. Statistical details of individual experiments, including number of replicates, analysed molecules or number of dwells used in the dwell time analyses are described in the manuscript text, figure legends, supplementary information or the Source Data. Every single-molecule experiment was performed on a different sample with two to three biological replicates (see details on number of replicates in figure captions and more information in Source Data file).Pvalues were determined via two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test in MATLAB and are reported as *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01 and ***P< 0.001. Values and test statistic can be found in Source Data. In all box plots, the centre line is the median, box edges indicate 25th and 75th percentiles and whiskers extend to 1.5× interquartile range.
