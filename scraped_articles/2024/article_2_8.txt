*** During reproduction, multiple species such as insects and all mammals undergo extensive physiological and morphological adaptions to ensure health and survival of the mother and optimal development of the offspring. Here we report that the intestinal epithelium undergoes expansion during pregnancy and lactation in mammals. This enlargement of the intestinal surface area results in a novel geometry of expanded villi. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK, encoded byTNFRSF11A) and its ligand RANKL were identified as a molecular pathway involved in this villous expansion of the small intestine in vivo in mice and in intestinal mouse and human organoids. Mechanistically, RANK–RANKL protects gut epithelial cells from cell death and controls the intestinal stem cell niche through BMP receptor signalling, resulting in the elongation of villi and a prominent increase in the intestinal surface. As a transgenerational consequence, babies born to female mice that lackRankin the intestinal epithelium show reduced weight and develop glucose intolerance after metabolic stress. Whereas gut epithelial remodelling in pregnancy/lactation is reversible, constitutive expression of an active form of RANK is sufficient to drive intestinal expansion followed by loss of villi and stem cells, and prevents the formation ofApcmin-driven small intestinal stem cell tumours. These data identify RANK–RANKL as a pathway that drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy/lactation, one of the most elusive and fundamental tissue remodelling events in mammalian life history and evolution.

*** Pregnancy is an important transient physiological state that coincides with substantial metabolic and cellular shifts to support maternal health and optimal growth and survival of offspring1,2,3. This adaptation is a conserved driving force on an evolutionary scale in probably all reproductive species, including insects4,5and mammals1,2,3. Although such adaptation events are critical for the health of mother and offspring, many remodelling aspects are still poorly understood, particularly in mammals. As pregnancy and nourishment of the babies necessitates increased nutritional efficacy in the mothers, a fundamental, unanswered question relates to the cellular and molecular changes of the gut epithelial lining and its orchestration during pregnancy and lactation.

*** RANKL (encoded byTNFSF11, also known as ODF, TRANCE and OPGL) and its receptor RANK (also known as TRANCE-R and ODF-R) are essential for the development and activation of osteoclasts and therefore have a critical role in bone remodelling6,7. The RANK–RANKL system also controls lymph node organogenesis8, development of thymic medullary epithelial cells9,10, central thermoregulation11and, in pregnancy, the formation of a lactating mammary gland12as well as rewiring of the thymic epithelium13. Expression of RANKL is strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines and hormones involved in reproduction, such as prolactin and progesterone14,15,16. An imbalance of sex hormones, either due to reduced ovarian function or synthetic progesterone derivatives in hormone replacement therapies and contraceptives, disrupts the RANK–RANKL system and can thereby promote osteoporosis or breast cancer16.

*** Hormones involved in pregnancy and lactation have similarly been implicated in intestinal functions17. Notably, osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL, was first cloned from a fetal rat intestinal cDNA library, suggesting that the RANK–RANKL system might also function in the intestine. Indeed, RANK–RANKL is required for the differentiation of microfold cells (M cells) in Peyer’s patches, contributing to microbial sampling and promoting IgA production in the intestine18,19,20. Besides M cells, little is known about the role of intestinal RANK–RANKL. Here we identify RANK and RANKL as regulators of intestinal stem cells and intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy and lactation.

*** We assessed RANK expression in the intestine. RANK was found on the cell surface of almost all mouse intestinal epithelial cells in the intestine including differentiated enterocytes and stem cells, except for epithelial cells located at the top of villi (Fig.1aand Extended Data Fig.1a). To directly test whether RANK has a functional role in the intestinal epithelium, we exposed mouse intestinal organoids to RANKL. Stimulating jejunal organoids with RANKL enhanced their growth; however, at around day 3, the numbers of organoid buds decreased, and we observed aberrant budding elongation (Fig.1band Extended Data Fig.1b,c). Organoids can be passaged nearly indefinitely as they contain functional stem cells that correlate with bud numbers21. RANKL stimulation resulted in markedly decreased passaging capacities, and a complete inability to maintain organoids beyond passage 3, depending on the dose of RANKL (Extended Data Fig.1d,e). We demonstrated that RANKL treatment resulted in an initial expansion of CD44+cells, followed by a marked decrease inLgr5-eGFP+CD44+and OLFM4+stem cells (Fig.1c,dand Extended Data Fig.1f–h), providing a cellular correlate for the impaired passaging capacity. RANKL-driven changes can be observed in gut organoids from male and female mice. RANK activation of mouse intestinal organoids results in early growth stimulation followed by stem cell exhaustion and/or enhanced terminal differentiation.

*** We next performed gene expression profiling using bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). RANK stimulation of small intestinal organoids resulted in activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of multiple anti-apoptotic genes (Extended Data Fig.2a–c). It also resulted in upregulation of the BMP and MAPK–ERK pathways (Extended Data Fig.2d,e). RANK-dependent induction of the BMP pathway, in particularBmp2and the BMP2 downstream genesId2andId3, and anti-apoptotic genes such asBirc2,Birc3,Tnfaip3andBcl2l1was confirmed using quantitative PCR (qPCR; Extended Data Fig.2f,g). By contrast, RANKL treatment of organoids suppressed expression of the stem cell signature genesLgr5,Smoc2,Ephb2orAxin2. Notably, expression of some progenitor cell markers such asScn2b,Ascl2orCd44was induced by RANK stimulation (Extended Data Fig.2f,g). Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling of control and RANK-stimulated mouse organoids stratified nine distinct epithelial populations22. After RANK stimulation, we observed an additional population constituting M cells (Extended Data Fig.3a,b) as reported previously22,23. In control organoids,RankmRNA expression was found primarily in progenitor cell populations (Extended Data Fig.3c), indicating, together with our protein expression data, that RANK is transcribed in intestinal progenitors and RANK protein is subsequently maintained in the differentiated intestinal epithelium. Induction of anti-apoptotic genes was detected in stem cells, transit-amplifying (TA) cells and absorptive enterocyte lineage cells (Fig.1eand Extended Data Fig.3d). RANKL-treated organoids exhibited enhanced survival in response to radiation injury (Fig.1f). The marked upregulation of BMP2 was primarily observed in enterocyte (immature as well as mature) progenitors, but was also found at low levels in cycling stem cells; the BMP2-regulated target genesId2andId3were prominently induced in stem cells, TA cells and absorptive enterocytes (Fig.1gand Extended Data Fig.3e). Moreover, similar to bulk RNA-seq we observed enhanced NF-κB as well as increased MAPK–ERK pathway activation in these intestinal cell populations, with the exception of enteroendocrine, Paneth and tuft cells (Extended Data Fig.3f,g).

*** The BMP pathway is known to inhibit intestinal stem cell maintenance24,25. To assess whetherBmp2upregulation might be responsible for the observed phenotype, we treated RANK-stimulated organoids with the BMP receptor-blocker LDN-193189 (BMPi)26as well as with NOGGIN, which antagonizes BMP signalling21. BMPi treatment rescued the stem cell exhaustion phenotype of RANKL-treated organoids and the intestinal organoids could be maintained in culture (Fig.1hand Extended Data Fig.4a,b). NOGGIN also alleviated RANK-mediated stem cell exhaustion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1iand Extended Data Fig.4c). We next investigated whether RANK-induced stem cell exhaustion is caused by the attenuation of WNT β-catenin signalling, which is critical for stem cell renewal. Inhibition of GSK3β, which negatively regulates WNT–β-catenin signalling27, using the drug CHIR99021 had only a minor impact on the detrimental effects of RANK–RANKL on intestinal stem cell maintenance (Extended Data Fig.4d). We also treated organoids fromRnf43/Znrf3double-mutant mice; these double-mutant mice show enhanced WNT signalling in the intestine28. We again observed no rescue of the RANK-induced stem cell exhaustion inRnf43/Znrf3double-mutant organoids (Extended Data Fig.4e). Besides WNT, EGFR signalling has been shown to drive proliferation of intestinal stem cells21. At low EGF levels, we observed an even stronger RANKL effect on proliferation and growth, particularly in organoids generated from the lower ileum (Extended Data Fig.4f–m). However, RANKL treatment still induced stem cell exhaustion irrespective of low or high EGF levels (Extended Data Fig.4n–p). These data show that RANK–RANKL stimulation alters the stem cell niche through BMP2 signalling and enhances anti-apoptotic pathways as well as cell proliferation, resulting first in larger organoids of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells but, after prolonged stimulation, resulting in reduced stem cell numbers and disrupted organoid maintenance (Extended Data Fig.4q).

*** To investigate whether prolonged RANK activation leads to intestinal stem cell exhaustion in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse line that conditionally expresses a constitutively activeRANKmutant (Rosa26-LSL-caRANK) in the intestinal epithelium usingVillin1-promoter-driven Cre (Villin1-cre) (hereafter,caRANKvil-Tgmice) (Extended Data Fig.5a,b). This activating mutation in the cytosolic domain (amino acid 240) of human RANK was recently identified in a patient with malignant lymphoma29. ThecaRANKvil-Tgmice appeared to be normal at birth and initially exhibited normal growth until weaning age. At 3 weeks of age,caRANKvil-Tgmice exhibited a marked expansion of small intestinal villi; 3D reconstruction revealed increased villous length and enhanced villous volumes and surface areas (Fig.2aand Extended Data Fig.5c). Immunostaining showed reduced apoptosis in villi of 3-week-oldcaRANKvil-Tgmice compared with the controls (Extended Data Fig.5d,e). Proliferation of in vivo phosphorylated histone H3 labelled crypt cells appeared normal at 3 weeks of age (Extended Data Fig.5f,g). From weaning age,caRANKvil-Tgmice progressively lost weight and needed to be euthanized due to excessive weight loss (Extended Data Fig.5h). In the oldercaRANKvil-Tgmice, we observed reduced numbers of OLFM4+intestinal stem cells (Fig.2band Extended Data Fig.5i). Consequently, oldercaRANKvil-Tgmice exhibited markedly compromised proliferation of crypt cells (Extended Data Fig.5f,g) and, as expected from diminished stem cell numbers, the villi were reduced in length and these mice exhibited decreased numbers of crypts and villi (Fig.2cand Extended Data Fig.5j–l). Phenocopying our observations on sustained RANK–RANKL activation in vitro, expression of a constitutive active form of RANK in the intestinal epithelium, results first in villous expansion followed by stem cell loss, altered villous structures and premature death of the mice.

*** To further explore the underlying mechanism, we generated intestinal organoids fromcaRANKvil-Tgmice. Constitutive activation of RANK resulted in enhanced organoid growth, yet again reduced numbers of proliferating cells in the buds and impaired maintenance of stem cells as determined by their passaging capacity (Extended Data Fig.5m–o). Notably, as our constitutively active RANK mutant is still inducible by RANKL, addition of RANKL resulted in rapid growth arrest and even disintegration of all organoids (Extended Data Fig.5p). Moreover, organoids fromcaRANKvil-Tgmice were more resistant to radiation injury (Extended Data Fig.5q). Bulk RNA-seq profiling showed that constitutive RANK activation resulted in upregulation of an anti-apoptotic program, NF-κB activation, and induction ofBmp2and its target genesId2andId3, whereas expression of defined stem cell markers such asLgr5,Olfm4,Smoc2andEphb2was downregulated (Extended Data Fig.6a–d). Thus, expression of constitutively active RANK recapitulates results in RANKL-stimulated wild-type intestinal organoids.

*** We next assessed the in vivo functional relevance of NF-κB signalling, which was markedly deregulated after RANK activation. We observed substantial induction of phosphorylated IκB in intestinal epithelial cells isolated fromcaRANKvil-Tgmice, indicative of activated NF-κB signalling (Extended Data Fig.6e). Addition of the NF-κB inhibitor sc-514 rescued the RANK-driven BMP and anti-apoptotic gene expression phenotypes (Extended Data Fig.2g), indicating that NF-κB acts a key signalling pathway downstream of RANK. One key molecular adapter that couples RANK to the canonical NF-κB activation is TRAF6 (ref.30) (Extended Data Fig.6f). We deletedTraf6in intestinal cells by crossingTraf6floxedmice31toVillin1-cremice (hereafter,Traf6Δvilmice). Stimulation ofTraf6Δvilintestinal organoids partially rescued the effects of RANK–RANKL activation on stem cell exhaustion compared with organoids from control littermates (Extended Data Fig.6g). We crossed theTraf6Δvilmice tocaRANKvil-Tgmice. Deletion ofTraf6in intestinal epithelial cells enhanced the numbers of OLFM4+stem cells and restored the decreased villus length observed in oldercaRANKvil-Tgmice (Fig.2d,eand Extended Data Fig.6h). Thus, the effects of constitutively active RANK are partially driven by TRAF6 and NF-κB.

*** To determine whether constitutively active RANK regulates WNT-dependent aberrant stem cell expansion and adenoma initiation induced by loss of APC function, we crossedcaRANKvil-Tgmice toApcmin/+mice. APC acts downstream of WNT and theApcminmutation drives aberrant WNT activation, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and intestinal adenomatous polyposis in mice32.Apcmin/+mice exhibited premature death when RANK signalling was constitutively active in thecaRANKvil-TgApcmin/+mice (Extended Data Fig.6i). Importantly, whereasApcmin/+mice developed hundreds of adenomas in the small intestine, the numbers and sizes of adenomas were reduced in the survivingcaRANKvil-TgApcmin/+mice (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.6j–l). Notably, tumour organoids fromApcmin/+mice were still sensitive to the RANK–RANKL-driven exhaustion phenotype and were challenging to maintain for more than two passages in the presence of RANKL (Fig.2g). Thus, in vivo constitutively active RANK suppresses the growth ofApcminmutant intestinal stem cell tumours.

*** To assess the physiological role of RANK-driven villous expansion in intestinal homeostasis, we generated intestinal-epithelium-specificRank-knockout mice (RankΔvilmice)33. Intestinal RANK expression was abolished inRankΔvilmice (Fig.1aand Extended Data Figs.1aand7a,b). Notably, we did not observe Cre expression in the mammary tissue; moreoverRankΔvilmice exhibited normal expansion of the mammary tissue in pregnancy and lactation (Extended Data Fig.7c,d). Villous morphology was apparently not affected byRankdeletion in nulliparousRankΔvilmice (Fig.3aand Extended Data Fig.7e). The numbers of villous epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis and of OLFM4+intestinal stem cells and stem cell divisions were also unchanged (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.7f–j). In vitro intestinal organoid formation was comparable betweenRankΔvilandRankwild-type mice (RankWTmice), and organoids generated fromRankΔvilmice could be passaged in the presence of RANKL (Extended Data Fig.7k,l). Thus, the inactivation of RANK in intestinal epithelial cells does not disrupt intestinal stem cell homeostasis.

*** We next examined the physiological function of the RANK–RANKL system in the intestine. In pregnancy and lactation, it has been reported that the intestine adapts to the increased nutrient demands in multiple species34,35. Although this is one of the most fundamental adaptions in all mammals and many non-mammalian species4,5, the molecular signals driving this expansion have never been identified. Moreover, in mammals, very few studies have followed up on initial reports describing larger intestines in pregnancy, with sometimes opposing findings36,37,38. We therefore repeated decade-old experiments in wild-type andRankΔvilmice. We observed markedly larger intestines in late-stage pregnancy and in particular in lactating wild-type mice (Fig.3aand Extended Data Fig.7e,m,n). Food intake was increased in pregnancy with a sharp surge at the onset of lactation (Extended Data Fig.8a,b). We also detected crypt expansion in lactation and increased ratios of villus height to crypt depth (Extended Data Fig.8c,d). We performed pregnancy experiments in germ-free mice at two different experimental sites and found that intestinal epithelial expansion still occurred in the absence of an intestinal microbiome (Fig.3cand Extended Data Fig.8e,f). Furthermore, it is independent of the antigenic properties of the fetus, as we observed the same changes in syngenic and semiallogenic breeding (Extended Data Fig.8f). Moreover, removal of offspring at day 1 after birth to cease lactation resulted in smaller villi in the mothers (Fig.3dand Extended Data Fig.8g), suggesting that a prolactin feedback loop controls this expansion and involution. Treatment of lactating mice with cabergoline, a clinically used drug to reduce prolactin levels39, resulted in a reduction in the intestinal villi and, as a control, the mammary gland (Fig.3eand Extended Data Fig.8h,i). The morphological changes of the intestine in pregnancy/lactation is an intrinsic process that is primarily driven by pregnancy/lactation hormones that engage the RANK–RANKL pathway.

*** Using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, this expansion resulted in substantially longer villi and enhanced surface areas; the 3D villus volumes were increased in late-stage pregnancy (day 18.5 of pregnancy, P18, 5) and in lactating mice (Fig.3aand Extended Data Fig.7e). This enlargement also resulted in a more flattened geometry of the expanded villi, where the flat villi surface predominantly positions perpendicular to the flow of the intestinal content (Fig.3a, Extended Data Figs.7eand8jand Supplementary Videos1and2). InRankΔvilfemale mice, this intestinal villous expansion was impaired at late stages of pregnancy (P18.5) and lactation (lactation day 5 (L5)) compared with littermate and Cre controls (Fig.3a, Extended Data Figs.7eand8k,land Supplementary Videos3and4). Notably, whereas loss of RANK expression had no apparent effect on the increased crypt depth in pregnancy, increased villus height-to-crypt depth ratios were RANK–RANKL dependent (Extended Data Fig.8c,d). Previously it has been shown that RANK–RANKL is critical for the development of M cells in Peyer’s patches18,19,20, which were absent in ourRankΔvilfemale mice; however, we did not observe increased numbers of M cells in lactation (L5) nor ectopic M cells in villi (Extended Data Fig.8m–p). This lack of M cell expansion in pregnancy may be due to the fact that RANKL is highly expressed under the M cell domes of Peyer’s patches in nulliparous as well as lactating mice (Extended Data Fig.8q). Deletion ofTraf6in intestinal epithelial cells phenocopied the impaired epithelial expansion of lactatingRankΔvildams (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.8r).

*** Gene expression profiling of intestinal epithelium at L5 showed upregulation of BMP signalling as well as induction of anti-apoptotic genes, dependent on RANK expression (Extended Data Fig.9a), paralleling our findings in organoids andcaRANKvil-Tgmice. We therefore observed reduced cell death in the intestinal cells of lactating dams (Extended Data Fig.7g,h). Gene expression profiling at L5 further showed RANK-dependent expression of the molecular machineries involved in the uptake of lipids, amino acids, sugar or vitamins as well as induction of the prolactin activation pathway (Extended Data Fig.9b). Among the upregulated genes in lactation that were dependent on RANK were lipid receptors (such asCd36,Scarb1(encoding SR-BI) orNpc1l1) and lipid transporters (includingApob-48,Apoa1andApoa4) (Extended Data Fig.9c). Thus, RANK promotes differentiation of functional absorptive enterocytes during lactation. Notably, during lactation, stem cell proliferation was slightly upregulated as determined by migration of EdU-labelled cells, dependent on RANK–RANKL (Extended Data Fig.7i,j). Finally, we assessed expression of the intestinal stem cell marker OLFM4; we observed a small, albeit substantial, reduction in OLFM4+stem cells in the upper small intestine of lactating (L5) controls compared withRankΔvildams (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.7f), suggesting that lactatingRankΔvilmice have more intestinal stem cells but they require RANK for proliferation and differentiation. These changes in OLFM+stem cells were reversible and returned to non-pregnant baseline numbers after weaning (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.7f). Thus, RANK–RANKL, in part through TRAF6 signalling, constitutes a molecular pathway for intestinal epithelial adaptation during pregnancy and lactation.

*** In intestinal epithelial cells, we did not detect any apparent changes inRankexpression between nulliparous and lactating females, indicating that the system is controlled by RANKL levels. When we assessed RANKL in intestinal epithelial cells in lactating dams, there was no measurable RANKL protein. However, in lactating dams, we observed a trend towards increased RANKL-expressing cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine (Extended Data Fig.10a,b). When we treated ex vivo cultured lamina propria cells with prolactin, we observed induction of RANKL expression (Extended Data Fig.10c). To identify the RANKL expressing cell type(s), we performed scRNA-seq analysis of mouse lamina propria cells; in lactating mice,Ranklexpression was observed in T cells, innate ILC2 and ILC3 cells, and a small fraction of mesenchymal cells (Extended Data Fig.11a–d). Recently, it has been shown that RANKL is expressed in parenchymalTwist2-expressing cells19. When we deletedRanklusing theTwist2-cremouse line, RANKL+cells in the lamina propria of lactating females were only sparsely present in lactatingRanklΔTwist2dams (Extended Data Fig.10a,b,d). Importantly, inRanklΔTwist2dams, villous expansion was impaired compared with in the control mice (Extended Data Fig.10e–h). Similarly, deletion ofRanklin T cells usingCd4-cre40(RanklΔCd4mice) resulted in impaired villous expansion in lactatingRanklΔCd4dams (Extended Data Fig.10i,j). By contrast, when we crossedRanklfloxedmice toRorgt-cremice to delete RANKL in innate ILC3 cells(RanklΔRorc), we did not observe an effect on intestinal epithelial expansion in lactation (Extended Data Fig.10k,l). Not excluding other cell types or the contribution of soluble RANKL, these data show that RANKL expression is induced in gut lamina propria cells during pregnancy/lactation and indicate thatTwist2-creexpressing mesenchymal cells and T cells are local sources for RANKL, which then activates RANK signalling on intestinal epithelial cells to drive adaptive villous expansion.

*** Adaptation of the intestinal epithelium in pregnancy has been proposed to allow for enhanced nutritional demands in pregnancy and lactation34,35,41. In the intestines of lactating female mice, we observed RANK-dependent expression of molecular machines involved in the uptake of lipids, amino acids, sugar or vitamins (Extended Data Fig.9b). Consequently, in serum ofRankWTdams, we detected an increase in defined lipids as well as iron compared with in nulliparous females; this increase in lactating dams was in part dependent on RANK expression in the gut epithelium (Extended Data Fig.12a,b). Free amino acids in the serum were largely unchanged (Extended Data Fig.12c). We next collected the milk of lactatingRankΔvilmothers. Compared with the controls, the milk ofRankΔvildams contained reduced levels of multiple fatty acids, triglycerides and lipid soluble vitamin A, whereas amino acids or the hydrophilic vitamins B1, B2 and B4 appeared normal (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.13a–c). Importantly, we also observed a strong reduction in mucosal IgA, but not IgG, in the milk of lactatingRankΔvilfemale mice (Fig.4b). Ablation of RANK in the intestinal epithelium of dams results in metabolic and immunological alterations in the milk of the lactating mother.

*** In humans, children born to mothers with reduced nutrient intake in pregnancy, as observed in the Dutch famine of 1944, can experience long-term health complications, such as proclivity to insulin intolerance42. We therefore followed the fate of pups born toRankΔvilmothers. At embryonic day 18.5, the fetuses ofRankΔvildams already exhibited substantially decreased body weights compared with embryos fromRankWTdams (Extended Data Fig.14a). After birth, the pups born toRankΔvildams continued to exhibit reduced weights, in particular during the nursing period, and remained smaller throughout life (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.14b,c). The numbers of offspring were comparable amongRankWTandRankΔvilmothers (Extended Data Fig.14d). When we exposed offspring born toRankΔvilandRankWTmothers to a high-fat diet (HFD), both groups gained weight, although the offspring ofRankΔvilmothers exhibited lower absolute weights throughout the observation period (Extended Data Fig.14e). Importantly, we observed impaired glucose tolerance and increased fasting glucose in the offspring ofRankΔvilmothers on the HFD (Fig.4d–f). Calculation of the HOMA-IR index resistance confirmed pronounced insulin resistance in the offspring ofRankΔvilfemale mice (Fig.4g,h). Glucose metabolism appeared unaffected in the offspring ofRankΔvildams that were fed a normal chow diet (Extended Data Fig.14f,g). Thus, RANK-dependent villous expansion in the mothers is required for efficient nourishment of their offspring and results in transgenerational glucose intolerance under metabolic stress.

*** Data mining43in humans showed that, similar to mice,RANK, but notRANKL, is expressed on stem cells, TA cells and absorptive enterocytes (Extended Data Fig.15a,b). We therefore examined whether RANK-mediated intestinal epithelial expansion also occurs in humans. We generated human duodenal organoids from a healthy female donor and RANKL stimulation indeed triggered morphological changes (Fig.5a). RANKL stimulation of the human duodenal organoids again induced anti-apoptosis genes and the BMP pathway (Extended Data Fig.15c). Consistent with the induction of an anti-apoptotic program, RANKL treatment promoted cell survival after irradiation of these human intestinal organoids (Fig.5b).

*** RANK stimulation also affected cell division (Fig.5c) and abrogated passaging of human duodenal organoids (Fig.5d). Notably, when cultured under suboptimal growth conditions, RANKL initially triggered enhanced proliferation, followed by growth arrest and stem cell exhaustion within 3 days of culture (Extended Data Fig.15d–g). OLFM4 immunostaining revealed a reduced number of intestinal stem cells in RANKL-treated human organoids (Extended Data Fig.15g,h). We were able to rescue RANK-induced reduction of OLFM4+stem cells and the proliferation defect using the BMP receptor-blocker LDN-193189 (BMPi) (Fig.5eand Extended Data Fig.15h). To validate the role of BMP signalling in RANK-induced stem cell exhaustion, we exposedBMPR1A-knockout44human intestinal organoids to RANKL; genetic inhibition of the BMP signalling pathway completely rescued RANK-driven stem cell exhaustion (Fig.5d,f). Thus, our observations in mice hold true in humans: RANK–RANKL drives growth of intestinal organoids and, at the same time, controls the self-renewal ability of intestinal stem cells through BMP signalling.

*** How mothers adapt to the demands of pregnancy remains a central question of evolution and human health. During pregnancy and lactation, hormone dynamics affect several organs to control and change their morphologies and functions, critically required for the health of the mother and the development of the offspring2,3. Our data reveal that, during pregnancy and lactation, RANKL is induced in parenchymal T cells and mesenchymal cells in the intestine. Whether membrane-bound and/or soluble RANKL from other cell types also contributes to the intestinal phenotype needs to be established. RANKL activates its receptor RANK on intestinal stem cells and differentiated enterocytes. RANK activation induces survival of the intestinal epithelial cells, in part through TRAF6 coupling to the NF-κB pathway, and through BMP signalling critically controls stem cell differentiation and the self-renewal capacity of intestinal stem cells, both of which appear to contribute to the expansion of small intestinal epithelial cells in pregnancy and lactation (Extended Data Fig.15i). A potential cross-talk between BMP and apoptotic pathways on intestinal stem cells cannot be excluded. Furthermore, RANK is expressed on multiple types of intestinal epithelial cells and its role in these cells needs to be investigated.

*** In mouse and human organoids and, importantly, in pregnancy in mice, RANK stimulation triggers induction of the BMP2 pathway that suppresses self-renewal of intestinal stem cells and promotes differentiation24,25. In vivo constitutive RANK activation also results in the expansion of intestinal villi followed by stem cell exhaustion, villus shrinkage and death of about 50% of these mice. Notably, chronic activation of the RANK–RANKL system incaRANKvil-Tgmice abolished WNT-driven intestinal tumorigenesis when crossed to anApcmin/+background. Intestinal tumour organoids fromApcmin/+mice were still sensitive to RANKL-triggered stem cell exhaustion; whether this could be exploited for future intestinal cancer treatment needs to be explored. Importantly, whereas permanent induction of RANK signalling drives stem cell exhaustion in vivo, RANK-mediated changes in stem cells and villus expansion in pregnancy/lactation are reversible, regulated by the prolactin axis, a known and very strong inducer of RANKL expression12. Whether such reversibility is controlled by the duration of the RANK stimulus in vivo or might be regulated by additional signals needs to be determined. As we observed effects of RANK stimulation in both male and female mouse gut organoids, and male human organoids have not been tested yet, it might be interesting to examine whether this system controls gut remodelling only in female pregnancy or whether it also affects intestinal homeostasis in male individuals.

*** Multiple maternal tissues change during and after pregnancy to maintain the health of the mother and to facilitate the development of the fetus and nurturing of babies1,2,3. Such changes also occur in non-mammalian species making it a universal hallmark of evolutionary fitness4. Mothers need to respond to the increased nutritional demand in pregnancy and, in the case of mammals, lactation45. Although such nutritional demands are fundamental for the short- and long-term health of mothers and their offspring, little was known about the adaption of the mammalian intestine. Our results show that, in pregnancy and lactation, RANK–RANKL controls intestinal stem cell differentiation and promote enterocyte survival, thereby expanding differentiated epithelial cells. RNA-seq showed strong upregulation of multiple machineries involved in nutrient uptake. Indeed, multiple lipids and vitamins are altered in the serum19,46and the milk and, importantly, IgA in the milk ofRankΔvildams; IgA secreted in the milk has a key role in protecting suckling infants from microbial infections47. Our data show that villous expansion is triggered by female pregnancy hormones and the RANK–RANKL axis based on experiments with organoids and germ-free mice. Alterations in the microbiome, M cells and/or altered IgA levels might also contribute to the observed effects in pregnancy and lactation, and thereby affect the nutritional state of mothers and offspring, which remains an open question. Unfortunately, we did not test direct nutrient absorption in pregnancy/lactation owing to ethical and technical constraints, and this will be important to address in future experiments. It is important to note that milk is not a simple product of intestinal nutrient absorption and that there are differences between rodents and humans in nutrient absorption during pregnancy and lactation, for example, for calcium absorption important for bone health48,49. As observed in malnutrition and famines such as the Dutch famine42, proper nutrition of mothers during pregnancy and lactation affects the long-term metabolism of the babies50. Our data now show that RANK–RANKL-dependent intestinal epithelial expansion in the mothers is important not only for offspring growth but also for their metabolic health in adult life.

*** The elongation and volume expansion of the villi result in the formation of more sheet-like geometries, where, similar to non-pregnant mice, the flat villi surfaces are positioned to face the flow of the intestinal content. Thus, it appears that villi expansion not only enhances the epithelial surface in the key intestinal region involved in nutrient uptake, but this morphological alignment presumably further facilitates nutritional absorption through biomechanical slowing of food movement. Our findings on RANK–RANKL-driven expansion of the intestinal epithelium through reduced cell death and stem cell maintenance identify a pathway for maternal adaptation to increased nutrient demand during pregnancy and lactation, with vital relevance to evolution and human health.

*** Rankconditional mice (Rankflox) were generated in our laboratory and have been previously described11. The following additional mouse strains were used:Ranklconditional mice (Ranklflox)51,Traf6conditional mice (Traf6flox)31, constitutively activeRANKmutant over-expressing mice (caRANKLSL)29,Rnf43conditional mice (Rnf43flox) andZnrf3conditional mice (Znrf3flox)28.Vilcremice33.Apcmin/+mice32,Twist2cremice52,Cd4cremice40,Rorgtcremice53, tdTomato reporter mice54andLgr5-eGFP-IRES-creERT2mice55were purchased from the Jackson laboratories. All mouse lines were maintained on a C57BL/6J genetic background and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mouse cages were individually ventilated and subjected to ambient temperature of 22 ± 1 °C under a 14 h–10 h light–dark cycle. Mouse genotypes were assessed by PCR. For all experiments, only littermate and sex-matched mice were used, unless otherwise specified. Control littermates ofcaRANKvil-Tgmice were defined asVilcremice, heterozygouscaRANKLSLmice or wild-type mice (negative forVilcreand negative forcaRANKLSL).

*** We did not observe any apparent differences among control littermates with different genotypes in any experiments. To exclude the potential effects of theRankdeletion in the intestine in timed pregnancy/lactation studies,RankWTandRankΔvilfemale littermates were crossed to wild-type syngeneic C57BL/6J male breeders, resulting in RANK-sufficient fetuses with a comparable genetic background. For the offspring analysis, we used theRankWTandRankΔvilfemale littermates who delivered more than five mice to avoid the effects of different offspring numbers. All mice were bred, maintained, examined and euthanized in accordance with institutional animal care guidelines and ethical animal license protocols approved by the legal authorities. All experimental animal projects performed at Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IMBA), Vienna BioCenter were approved by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research. Animal experiments using Germ-free mice at the University of British Columbia were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Animal experiments using germ-free mice at Kiel University were approved prior to the study by the committee for animal welfare of the state of Schleswig-Holstein (V242-7224.121-33). Timed matings were performed in germ-free and specific-pathogen-free mice to achieve syngenic (both parents C57BL/6) and semiallogenic breedings (male BALB/C, female C57BL/6).

*** Mouse intestinal organoids were established as described previously21. In brief, freshly isolated intestinal crypts were mixed with 10 μl Matrigel (Corning, 356231) and placed on a warmed 24-well plate dish to let them polymerize. The crypts were then cultured with a ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; Sigma-Aldrich, Y0503, 10 μM) and ENR (EGF/NOGGIN/R-spondin) medium composed of advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX, N2 (Life Technologies), B27 (Life Technologies) and 1 mMN-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 ng ml−1mouse recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech), R-spondin1 (conditioned medium from 293T-HA-RspoI-Fc cells, 10% final volume), and 100 ng ml−1NOGGIN (Peprotech). Passage was performed weekly at a 1:6 split ratio. To explore ERK/MAPK-dependent phenotypes, we cultured organoids using a low concentration of EGF (50 ng ml−1to 50 pg ml−1) in ENR medium (ElowNR medium).

*** To assess organoid survival (Fig.1f), 25 irradiated organoids were dissociated into single cells by TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) treatments for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequent vigorous pipetting through a p200 pipette. The dissociated cells were mixed with 15 μl Matrigel and seeded into each well of a 48-well plate. The organoids were then further cultured in WENR medium. WENR medium was composed of WNT3A (conditioned medium (CM) from WNT3A L-cells, 50% final volume), 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, StemCell Technologies) and 10 μM nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich), on the basic ENR medium. Bright-field images of organoids were taken using a Carl Zeiss Axiovert.A1 microscope. For the measurement of organoid size, organoid areas in horizontal cross sections were measured using Fiji software (ImageJ, v.2.3.0).

*** Intestinal biopsy specimens were collected from the duodenum of children undergoing diagnostic endoscopy. This study was conducted with informed patient and/or caretaker consent as appropriate, and with full ethical approval by East of England - Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee (REC-12/EE/0482).

*** Human intestinal organoids were generated from mucosal biopsy specimens by isolating intestinal crypts and culturing those in Matrigel (Corning) using medium described previously56. The medium was replaced every 48–72 h. Once organoids were established, they were further cultured in an expansion medium composed of advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX, N2 (Life Technologies), B27 (Life Technologies), 1 mMN-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), R-spondin1 (conditioned medium from 293T-HA-RspoI-Fc cells, 10% final volume), 100 ng ml−1NOGGIN (Peprotech), 10 nM human gastrin I (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris), WNT3A (conditioned medium from WNT-producing L-cell line, 50% final volume), 50 ng ml−1mouse recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech), 100 ng ml−1human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; BioLegend), and 50 ng ml−1human recombinant fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF-2; Peprotech)43. To test the role of RANKL under suboptimal growth conditions, we used a growth-factor-reduced condition lacking EGF, IGF-1 and FGF-2 from the expansion medium. To assess organoid survival, organoids were irradiated and subsequently dissociated into single cells using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) treatments for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequent vigorous pipetting using a p200 pipette. The dissociated cells were mixed with 15 μl Matrigel (Corning, 356231) and seeded into a 48-well plate. The organoids were then further cultured in expansion medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM, StemCell Technologies). HumanBMPR1Amutant organoids have been described previously44.

*** Small intestinal adenomas were collected fromApcmin/+heterozygous mice. Tissues were incubated with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (StemCell Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature and vortexed vigorously to remove non-transformed crypts surrounding the tumour. The remaining tissue was minced into 2–5 mm fragments, and further digested in TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) for 10 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 300gfor 5 min, suspended in Matrigel and seeded into a 24-well plate. The seeded cells were cultured with advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX, N2 (Life Technologies), B27 (Life Technologies) and 50 ng ml−1mouse recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech). The medium was replaced every 2 days. Tumoroids were passaged every 5 days.

*** The protocol was adapted from a previous study57. In brief, half of the upper small intestinal tissue from nulliparous female mice was washed with cold PBS, Peyer’s patches were removed manually, and then the remaining specimens were incubated in 10 ml of gentle dissociation solution (HBSS with 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich)) on ice for 20 min. The tissues were shaken vigorously, and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining tissue fragments were cut into 2–5 mm fragments and seeded in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 ng ml−1mouse recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech). Once mesenchymal cells started outgrowth from the tissue fragment, attached cells were dissociated with trypsin, seeded in six-well dishes and subsequently grown to expand mesenchymal cells. Then, 3 days before stimulation with recombinant mouse prolactin (rmProlactin) (Peprotech), the culture medium was changed to DMEM with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and 50 ng ml−1of EGF.

*** Organoid growth was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Organoids were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg ml−1, final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 37 °C and the cells containing formazan were subsequently solubilized with 10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl. The absorbance of the formazan product was measured at 550 nm using BioTek Synergy 2. Absorbance at 720 nm was subtracted from sample values measured at 550 nm. Furthermore, the absorbance values of wells containing Matrigel and medium, but not organoids, were subtracted as background controls.

*** For flow cytometry, organoids were dissociated with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequent vigorous pipetting. The cell suspension was washed with DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS. Dead cells were fluorescently labelled using a fixable viability dye (eBioscience, 1:1,200). Antibody labelling of cells was performed in FACS staining buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA) on ice for 30 min after blocking Fc receptors. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, 1:100). The following antibody was used: anti-CD44 (IM7, eBioscience, 1:200).Lgr5-eGFP+CD44+cells were assessed on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences). The data were analysed using the FlowJo software (Treestar).

*** A total of 20 cm of upper small intestinal tissue was washed with cold PBS, Peyer’s patches were removed manually and the remaining specimens were then incubated in 10 ml of gentle dissociation solution (HBSS with 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich)) on ice for 20 min. The tissues were shaken vigorously, and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining tissue fragments were washed with 10 ml of HBSS buffer, cut into 2–5 mm fragments and further digested in dissociation solution (advanced DMEM with 0.15 mg ml−1of collagenase P (Roche), 0.8 mg ml−1of dispase (Gibco) and 400 IU ml−1of DNase I (Worthington)) using the GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 ml tube, then centrifuged at 300gfor 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. Dead cells were fluorescently labelled using a fixable viability dye (eBioscience, 1:1,200). Antibody labelling of cells was performed in DMEM supplemented with 2%) on ice for 30 min after blocking Fc receptors. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, 1:100). The following antibodies was used: anti-CD31 (MEC13.3, BioLegend, 1:300) and anti-podoplanin (8.1.1, BioLegend, 1:300). TdTomato expression in podoplanin+CD31−mesenchymal cells was assessed on the LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences). The data were analysed using the FlowJo software (Treestar).

*** Intestinal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 h. The fixed samples were then incubated in 1% Triton X-100 solution at 4 °C overnight for permeabilization. The tissues were subsequently incubated in DAPI (1:500; Invitrogen, D3571), phalloidin (1:400; Invitrogen, A30107) or 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD, 1: 500: Invitrogen, D7757) at 4 °C for 48 h, followed by three washes with fresh PBS over 30 min periods. The labelled samples were transferred into RapiClear 1.49 (Sunjin Lab) overnight. The samples were mounted in a 0.50 mm i-spacer (Sunjin Lab) for confocal imaging. Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Thez-step size was set to 2.15 μm. Arivis Vision 4D was used for 3D Image visualization as shown in Figs.2a,cand3a,cand Extended Data Figs.8jand10d,e. Imaris was used for the image visualization shown in Supplementary Videos1–4.

*** For measuring the volume, surface and length of the villi from three-dimensional images, a custom ImageJ macro was created. The MorpholibJ library (v.1.4.1) (https://imagej.net/plugins/morpholibj) and ImageScience library (v.3.1.0) (https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/imagescience/) were used. In the first step, the image was downsampled, the crypt region was annotated manually on several 2D-slices, then interpolated to cover the volume in 3D. The crypts were removed to focus on the villi only. To create seed objects and separate the individual villi, a combination of binary operations and Laplacian of Gaussian filtering was used iteratively. The resulting objects were then regrown to their original size by 3D watershed and villi were analysed separately. Length measurement was performed using a distance map starting at the base of the villi, then reading out the maximum intensity. Volume and surface measurements were also performed on the segmented objects using MorpholibJ library.

*** For cell cycle analysis, organoids were incubated with 10 μM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 1 h and subsequently dissociated with TrypLE and DNase I. After dead cells were fluorescently labelled with a viability dye (eBioscience, 1:1,200), dissociated cells were fixed, permeabilized using a fixation/permeabilization kit (eBioscience) and finally stained using the Click-iT EdU kit (Life Technologies). Cell cycle stages were analysed using flow cytometry. For whole-mount imaging of EdU labelling, organoids were incubated with 10 μM EdU for 2 h and subsequently fixed and counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.

*** EdU (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered at 100 mg per kg body weight intraperitoneally. The time of day for EdU delivery was consistent for all the animals used. Then, 24 h after administration, mouse intestinal tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 h. Whole-mount tissues were incubated in 1% Triton X-100 solution at 4 °C overnight for permeabilization. The EdU-incorporated cells were labelled using the Click-iT Edu kit (Life Technologies). The tissues were subsequently incubated in DAPI (1:500; Invitrogen, D3571) at 4 °C for 48 h, followed by three washes with fresh PBS over 30 min periods. The labelled samples were transferred into RapiClear 1.49 (Sunjin Lab) overnight. The samples were mounted in a 0.50 mm i-spacer (Sunjin Lab) for confocal imaging. Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Thez-step size was set to 2.15 μm. Intestinal epithelial cell migration distance was defined as the distance from the crypt base to the EdU-positive cells that had migrated the farthest and was measured using Imaris software.

*** For histological analysis, the dissected mouse intestines or human intestinal organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. 2 μm paraffin-sections were deparaffinized by xylene substitute (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shandon) and rehydrated. Rehydrated sections were stained with H&E for morphological assessment. For immunohistochemistry, after rehydration of the sections, epitopes were retrieved using sodium citrate pH 6 with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 min or using the BOND Enzyme Pretreatment Kit (Leica AR9551) for 5 min. The sections were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA (VWR Life Science) and 10% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, 9023) and incubated with primary antibodies against phospho-histone H3 (1:100; CellPath, PBC-ACI3130C), mouse OLFM4 (1:800; Cell Signaling Technology, 39141), human OLFM4 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, 14369), cleaved caspase-3 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, 9661) or CRE (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, 15036), all diluted in blocking solution. For detecting M cells, sections were blocked for 1 h in 2% BSA (ready to use; VWR Life Science) and 5% rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, R9133) and incubated with a primary antibody against glycoprotein 2 (1:150, MBL Life Science, D278-3). The sections were subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody (HRP-polymer rabbit, DCS (PD000POL-K)) and DAB (Abcam, ab64238). Finally, the sections were counter-stained with non-acidified haematoxylin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 6765002). For detecting CRE, TMB substrate (SZABO SCANDIC) was used as replacement for DAB, in combination with Nuclear fast red. Slides were then scanned using the Mirax Scanner (Zeiss) and representative images were acquired using the Panoramic Viewer Software v.2.4.0 (3DHistech). The sections were examined with blinding to the genotype of the mice.

*** Intestinal tissues were isolated from mice following trans-cardiac perfusion with PBS containing heparin and snap-frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura). 14 μm cryosections were prepared, air-dried at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently fixed in ice-cold acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. The slides were blocked in 0.3% H2O2for 60 min, Avidin/Biotin blocking buffer (Vector Laboratories) for 15 min and 10% goat serum (Alexa Fluor Tyramide SuperBoost Kit) for 60 min at room temperature, and subsequently stained with biotinylated anti-RANK antibodies (BAF692; R&D systems; 1:50) or biotinylated anti-RANKL antibodies (13-5952-82; Invitrogen; 1:150) at 4 °C overnight. The Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) System (Alexa Fluor Tyramide SuperBoost Kit) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For further multiplexing, additional stainings were performed after the TSA fluorescence protocol. In brief, slides were stained at 4 °C overnight with anti-PDGFRα antibodies (AF1062, R&D Systems, 1:150) in 2% BSA/PBST (0.1% Tween-20), followed by donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 555 (A21432, Invitrogen, 1:500) as the secondary antibody. For the detection of intestinal epithelial cells, anti-EPCAM Alexa Fluor 488 (118210, BioLegend, 1:100) was used. Phalloidin and DAPI were used for membrane staining and nuclear counterstaining, respectively. Confocal images were obtained using the Zeiss LSM 700 and Zeiss LSM 710 microscopes.

*** For the whole-mount staining of mouse and human organoids, organoids were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min, followed by incubation with blocking and permeabilization solution consisting of 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween-20, 2% BSA and 2% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Mouse organoids were stained at 4 °C overnight with anti-mouse OLFM4 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology, 39141) in blocking and permeabilization solution. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 633 (1:500; Invitrogen, A21072) was used as a secondary antibody. Human organoids were stained with anti-human OLFM4 antibodies (1:100; Cell Signaling, 14369) at 4 °C overnight and the TSA Fluorescence System (Alexa Fluor Tyramide SuperBoost Kit) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Phalloidin and DAPI were used for membrane staining and nuclear counterstaining, respectively. Confocal images were obtained using Zeiss LSM 700 and Zeiss.

*** Mammary glands were dissected from mice, spread on glass slides and fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform and 10% glacial acetic acid) overnight. The slides were washed in 70% ethanol for 15 min, 30% for 15 min, rinsed in distilled water for 5 min, stained in carmine alum stain (2.5 g alum potassium sulfate and 1.0 g carmine in 500 ml of double-distilled H2O) and then washed in 70% ethanol until fat was clear and glands still visible. Subsequently, the slides were dehydrated in 95% ethanol and 100% ethanol for 1 h, respectively, followed by 1 h in xylene. The dehydrated samples were mounted with EukitNeo mounting medium. Whole-mount images were obtained using Zeiss Axio Zoom.V16.

*** Western blotting was performed using standard protocols. Total protein was extracted from isolated intestinal epithelial cells. To isolate intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal tissues were minced into around 5 mm fragments and further incubated with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (StemCell Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature. The tissue fragments were vigorously resuspended and isolated intestinal epithelial cells collected by passing through a 70 µm cell strainer (SZABO SCANDIC). Isolated intestinal epithelial cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78440). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST (1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and 0.1% Tween-20) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, diluted in 5% BSA in TBST (1:1,000 dilution). Blots were washed three times in TBST for 15 min, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution; GE Healthcare, NA9340V) for 45 min at room temperature, washed three times in TBST for 15 min and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Pierce, 1896327). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-β-actin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, A5316); anti-IκBα (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, 9247) and anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser32/36) (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, 9246). Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:5,000; GE Healthcare, NA9340V) and anti-mouse IgG HRP (1:5,000; Promega, W4021).

*** Total RNA was extracted from intestinal organoids or intestinal epithelial cells. To isolate intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal tissues were minced into around 5 mm tissue pieces and then incubated with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (StemCell Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature. The tissue fragments were vigorously resuspended and the isolated intestinal epithelial cells collected by passing through a 70 µm cell strainer (SZABO SCANDIC). Total RNA isolation was performed using the RNA isolation kit (VBCF) which uses a lysis step based on guanidine thiocyanate (adapted from ref.58) and magnetic beads (GE Healthcare, 65152105050450) applied on a KingFisher instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 5 min incubation at room temperature, DNA was digested with DNase I (New England BioLabs) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a series of washing steps. RNA was eluted from the beads in 50 μl RNase-free water for 2 min at room temperature. Equivalent quantities of total RNA were reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA using a LunaScript RT SuperMix Kit (New England BioLabs). qPCR was performed using Luna Universal qPCR master Mix (New England BioLabs). Primer sequences were as follows:Gapdhforward, CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTG;Gapdhreverse, ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG;Rankforward, CCCAGGAGAGGCATTATGAG;Rankreverse, CACACACTGTCGGAGGTAGG;Ranklforward, GTGAAGACACACTACCTGACTCC;Ranklreverse, GCCACATCCAACCATGAGCCTT;Birc2forward, CCACTTCAGACACCCCAGGA;Birc2reverse, TTCCGAACTTTCTCCAGGGC;Birc3forward, GCGTTCAGAGCCTAGGAAGT;Birc3reverse, GTGAGATGACAGGGAGGGGA;Tnfaip3forward, AGCAAGTGCAGGAAAGCTGGCT;Tnfaip3reverse, GCTTTCGCAGAGGCAGTAACAG;Bcl2forward, CCTGTGGATGACTGAGTACCTG;Bcl2reverse, AGCCAGGAGAAATCAAACAGAGG;Bcl2l1forward, GCCACCTATCTGAATGACCACC;Bcl2l1reverse, AGGAACCAGCGGTTGAAGCGC;Lgr5forward, CGGGACCTTGAAGATTTCCT;Lgr5reverse, GATTCGGATCAGCCAGCTAC;Bmp2forward, TGCTTCTTAGACGGACTGCG;Bmp2reverse, TGGGGAAGCAGCAACACTAG;Id2forward, CCAGAGACCTGGACAGAACC;Id2reverse, CGACATAAGCTCAGAAGGGAAT;Id3forward, AGCTCACTCCGGAACTTGTG;Id3reverse, AGAGTCCCAGGGTCCCAAG;GABDHforward, AATGAAGGGGTCATTGATGG;GABDHreverse, AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA;BIRC2forward, CAGACACATGCAGCTCGAATGAG;BIRC2reverse, CACCTCAAGCCACCATCACAAC;BIRC3forward, GCTTTTGCTGTGATGGTGGACTC;BIRC3reverse, CTTGACGGATGAACTCCTGTCC;TNFAIP3forward, CTCAACTGGTGTCGAGAAGTCC;TNFAIP3reverse, TTCCTTGAGCGTGCTGAACAGC;BCL2L1forward, GCCACTTACCTGAATGACCACC;BCL2L1reverse, AACCAGCGGTTGAAGCGTTCCT;BMP2forward, TGTATCGCAGGCACTCAGGTCA;BMP2reverse, CCACTCGTTTCTGGTAGTTCTTC;ID2forward, TTGTCAGCCTGCATCACCAGAG;ID2reverse, AGCCACACAGTGCTTTGCTGTC;OLFM4forward, GACCAAGCTGAAAGAGTGTGAGG;OLFM4reverse, CCTCTCCAGTTGAGCTGAACCA.

*** The protocol for total RNA extraction was performed as described above in the ‘qPCR’ section. RNA quantification and quality control were performed using a DNF-471 Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis kit (Agilent) with a fragment analyzer. Equivalent quantities of total RNA were used for library preparation using the Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD from Illumina. The DNF-474 High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (1–6,000 bp) (Agilent) was used to determine the quality of the library with a fragment analyzer. 3′ RNA-seq (QuantSeq) reads were prepared for analysis by removing adaptor contamination, poly(A) read through and low-quality tails using bbmap v.36.92. Libraries were pooled at an equimolar ratio and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument using the single-read 50-read mode.

*** RNA-seq reads were trimmed using BBDuk v38.06 (ref=polyA.fa.gz,truseq.fa.gz k=13 ktrim=r useshortkmers=t mink=5 qtrim=r trimq=10 minlength=20). Reads mapping to abundant sequences included in the iGenomes UCSC GRCm38 reference (mouse rDNA, mouse mitochondrial chromosome, phiX174 genome, adapter) were removed using bowtie2 v.2.3.4.1 alignment. The remaining reads were analysed using genome and gene annotation for the GRCm38/mm10 assembly obtained fromMus musculusEnsembl release 94. Reads were aligned to the genome using star v.2.6.0c and reads in genes were counted with featureCounts (subread v.1.6.2) using strand-specific read counting for QuantSeq experiments (-s 1). Differential gene expression analysis on raw counts was performed using DESeq2, over-representation analysis with clusterProfiler v.4.4.4 and gene set enrichment analysis with fgsea v.1.22.0. The relevant signalling processes and biological functions were evaluated using the commercial QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen;www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) software. Thezscore was applied to predict a cellular process’ directional change, such as activating or inhibiting a cellular pathway. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to adjust canonical pathwayPvalues.

*** The protocol was modified from a previous study26. In brief, 20 cm of upper small intestinal tissue was carefully washed with cold PBS, Peyer’s patches were removed manually, and then the remaining specimens were incubated in 10 ml of gentle dissociation solution (HBSS with 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich)) on ice for 20 min. The tissues were shaken vigorously, and the supernatant was collected in a new conical tube, washed with HBSS buffer and suspended in 10 ml of HBSS buffer, suspension ‘A’. The remaining tissue fragments were washed with 10 ml of HBSS buffer, cut into 2–5 mm fragments and were further digested in dissociation solution (advanced DMEM with 0,15 mg ml−1of collagenase P (Roche), 0.8 mg ml−1of dispase (Gibco), and 400 IU ml−1of DNase I (Worthington)) using a GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 ml tube, then centrifuged at 300gfor 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellets were then combined with the cell suspension ‘A’. Dead cells were fluorescently labelled using a fixable viability dye (eBioscience, 1:1,200). Antibody labelling of cells was performed in DMEM supplemented with 2%) on ice for 30 min after blocking Fc receptors. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, 1:100). The following antibodies were used: anti-CD45 (IM7, eBioscience, 1:400) and EPCAM (G8.8, BioLegend, 1:800). Using FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD), CD45-positive and EPCAM-negative cells (Immune cells) and CD45−and EPCAM−cells (mesenchymal cells) were enriched by cell sorting.

*** Control mouse intestinal organoids and organoids cultured in the presence of recombinant mouse RANK ligand (rmRANKL, Oriental Yeast) for 12 h were dissociated with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequent vigorous pipetting through a p200 pipette. The cell suspension was washed with DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS. Cell viability and efficiency of dissociation were determined using Nucleocounter NC-250 (Chemometec) before the single cells were loaded into one channel of a 10x Chromium microfluidics chip to package them into one library. scRNA-seq libraries were generated using 10x Genomics kits. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

*** For each sample, 1 million cells were fixed for 22 h at 4 °C, quenched and stored at −80 °C according to 10x genomic Fixation of Cells & Nuclei for Chromium Fixed RNA profiling (CG000478, 10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Fixed RNA Sample preparation kit (PN-1000414, 10X Genomics). In total, 250,000 cells per sample were used for probe hybridization using the Chromium Fixed RNA Kit, mouse WTA probes (PN-1000496, 10X Genomics), pooled at equal numbers and washed following the Pooled Wash Workflow following the Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling Reagent kit protocol (CG000527, 10X Genomics). GEMs were generated using Next GEM ChipQ (PN-1000422, 10X Genomics) on the Chromium X (10X Genomics) system with a target of 10,000 cells recovered and libraries prepared according to the manufacturer instructions (CG000527, 10x Genomics). Sequencing was performed using NovaSeq S4 lane PE150 (Illumina) with a target of 15,000 reads per cell. Alignment of the samples was performed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 7.1.0 multi pipeline.

*** Reads were aligned to the reference mouse genome (mm10) downloaded from the 10x Genomics website (v.2020-A) using the Cell Ranger (v.5.0.1) count function with the default parameters. Genome annotation corresponded to Ensembl v98. The median number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell was between 23,501 and 25,058, with a median of 3,808–4,300 genes detected per condition. The computational analysis of the 10x Genomics UMI count matrices was performed using the R package Seurat (v.4.0.5). Cells were subjected to a quality-control step, keeping those cells expressing more than 1,000 genes and with less than 20% of UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes. Those thresholds were chosen after visual inspection of the distributions. Using this filtering, we retained between 844 and 2,299 cells, with a median of 3,877–4,512 genes per cell detected per condition. Genes expressed in less than three cells for a sample independently or in less than five cells when the samples were merged, were removed from the analyses. Each dataset was subjected separately to normalization, identification of highly variable genes and scaling using the SCTransform function. After obtaining principal components with RunPCA for each sample independently, we integrated them using reciprocal PCA (RPCA) to identify anchors with the FindIntegrationAnchors function (setting the reduction parameter to rpca), as we expect some cell type differences after rmRANKL treatment, therefore avoiding a possible overintegration.

*** To annotate cell populations, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.7 in a shared nearest neighbours graph constructed with the first 20 principal components, as implemented in the FindClusters and FindNeighbors Seurat functions. Nonlinear dimensional reduction for visualization was performed using the RunUMAP function with the same principal components. Cluster 6 was further subdivided in an unsupervised manner using the FindSubCluster function with a 0.6 resolution, enabling us to separate goblet and Paneth cells without splitting the rest of the clusters any further. Markers in each cluster were identified using the FindConservedMarkers and FindAllMarkers functions in the log-normalized counts by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Genes withPvalue < 0.05 (adjusted by Bonferroni’s correction) and a log2-transformed fold change of >0.25 were retained. Clusters were annotated in accordance with those makers, as well as considering small intestinal cell-type markers from previous studies22,26,59. To further confirm our classifications, cell type annotations from the small intestine scRNA-seq dataset from a previous study22were transferred using the TransferData function in Seurat after removing distal cells and simplifying the TA annotation in the reference. We used UCell to obtain scores for gene sets of interest in each cell. The plots were generated using the DimPlot and VlnPlot functions from Seurat as well as the ggplot2 and pheatmap R libraries.

*** For the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data from human intestinal crypt cells, the 10x Genomics scRNA-seq expression matrix of human intestinal crypt cells from a previous study43was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSM3389578). Cells were already filtered in the dataset. Clustering and UMAP dimensionality reduction were performed with Seurat using similar parameters as in their study, that is, considering the first 25 principal components and a k.param of 20 for FindNeighbors and a resolution of 0.6 in FindClusters. A small cluster corresponding to non-epithelial cells was detected and removed from the analyses, redoing the downstream analyses and unsupervised clustering with a 0.8 resolution. The clusters were annotated considering markers and labels from the original paper.

*** Sample demultiplexing and read alignment were performed using the Cell Ranger (v.7.2.0) multi-function with the default parameters, considering the reference mouse genome (mm10) downloaded from the 10x Genomics website (v.2020-A) and the Chromium_Mouse_Transcriptome_Probe_Set_v1.0.1_mm10-2020-A.csv probe set. The median number of UMIs per cell was between 4,063 and 5,902, with a median of 2,050–2,589 genes detected per condition. The computational analysis of the 10x Genomics UMI count matrices was performed using Seurat (v.4.2.0). Cells were subjected to a quality control step, keeping those cells expressing more than 500 genes, 1,000 UMIs and with less than 5% of UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes and cells considered singlets by scDblFinder (v.1.12.0) with the default parameters. Using this filtering, we retained between 6,822 and 9,396 cells, with a median of 2,008–2,451 genes per cell detected per condition. Genes expressed in less than three cells for a sample independently were removed from the analyses. Each dataset was subjected separately to normalization, identification of highly variable genes and scaling using the SCTransform function with vst.flavor v.2. We integrated the data using canonical correlation analysis.

*** To annotate cell populations, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.5 in a shared nearest-neighbours graph constructed with the first 17 principal components. Cluster 5 and 12 were subset, reintegrated with canonical correlation analysis after normalization with SCTransform and reclustered in an unsupervised manner with a 0.8 resolution and 15 principal components, allowing to further separate CD4 T cells and ILCs. Markers in each cluster were identified using the FindConservedMarkers and FindAllMarkers functions in the log-normalized counts by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Genes withPvalue < 0.05 (adjusted by Bonferroni’s correction) and a log2-transformed fold change of >0.25 were retained. Clusters were annotated in accordance with those markers, as well as considering small intestinal cell type markers as follows; naive CD4 T cells:Ccr7,Klf2,Sell. Activated T cells:Cd40Ig,Cd4. Th1 cells:Il12rb2,Ccr5. T helper 17 cells:Il17a,Il17f,Rora. Regulatory T cells:Foxp3,Ctla4,Il10,Tnfrsf4. Memory T cells:Zbtb16,Zfp683. CD8 T cells:Cd8a,Itgae,Gzma.

*** Lactating female mice were separated from their offspring at lactation day 8 and fasted for 5 h from 10:00 to 15:00. Subsequently, they were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2% induction and 1% maintenance) and injected with 2 IU of oxytocin (Sigma-Aldrich, O3251) intraperitoneally. Expressed milk was collected with a P20 pipette. Serum was collected from inferior vena cava from mice anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine and pooled into Micro sample tube Lithium heparin (Sarstedt). Serum samples were centrifuged at 2,000gfor 10 min at room temperature twice to separate from cells. All samples were then stored at −80 °C for further analysis. The concentrations of milk IgA and IgG were measured with an ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories).

*** Samples were prepared by adding 100 μl of a methanol/ethanol mixture (4:1, v/v) to 25 μl of the respective serum or milk samples in a 1.5 ml tube, followed by vortexing, incubation and centrifugation. The supernatants were transferred to HPLC vials and measured consecutively with reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) on-line coupled to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Then, 2.5 μl of each sample was pooled for quality control. Metabolite extracts were separated (HILIC) on a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (Merck, 100 × 2.1 mm; 5 µm) or a RP-column (Waters, ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 150 × 2.1; 1.8 μm) with a flow rate of 100 µl min−1, using the Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Focus (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). In HILIC, the gradient was ramped up in 21 min from 90% A (100% acetonitrile) to 60% B (25% ammonium bicarbonate in water). In RP, the 20 min gradient started with 99% A (0.1% formic acid in water) and ramped up to 60% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Eluting compounds were directly ionized by electrospray ionization in polarity switching mode. Spectra were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The ionization potential was set to +3.5/−3.0 kV, the sheath gas flow was set to 20, and an auxiliary gas flow of 5 was used. Obtained datasets were processed by Compound Discoverer 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Annotation was conducted by searching the metabolite databases (mzCloud, our in-house database, ChemSpider, BioCyc, Human Metabolome Database, KEGG, MassBank and MetaboLights) with a mass accuracy of 3 ppm for precursor masses and, if applicable, 10 ppm for fragment ion masses.

*** For measurement of triglycerides with LC–MS, lipids were extracted using chloroform–methanol extraction from each sample. The chloroform phase was removed and diluted 1:1 with methanol and 1 μl of each sample was directly injected on a Kinetex C8 column (100 Å, 150 × 2.1 mm) using a 20 min gradient of 80% A (60% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid, 40% water) to 95% B (90% isopropanol, 10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid and 5% water) using a flow rate of 100 µl min−1and a 60 °C column temperature. Triglycerides were detected and quantified in the positive-ion mode as their ammonium adducts.

*** For analysis of offspring delivered fromRankWTorRankΔvilfemale mice, the mice were fed normal chow from weaning age until 4 weeks of age, after which they were fed normal chow or HFD (60% kcal% fat, Research Diets, D12492i) for up to 25 weeks. The pups were weekly weighed starting from postnatal day 7 until 25 weeks. For oral glucose-tolerance tests, mice (aged 25 weeks) were fasted overnight and were then administrated an oral glucose bolus by gavage (2 g per kg for normal chow-fed mice and 1 g per kg for HFD-fed mice). Glucose concentrations were measured using glucometers from blood taken by tail nick at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min after glucose ingestion, using a handheld blood glucose meter (One Touch UltraEasy; Lifescan). The area under the glucose-tolerance test curve was calculated for each mouse using GraphPad Prism v.9.3.1c (GraphPad Software). For analysis of insulin levels, tail-vein blood samples were added to Micro sample tube Lithium heparin (Sarstedt) to avoid blood clotting. Plasma insulin levels were measured using the Alpco Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA (80-INSMSU-E10). For each litter of offspring, blood samples were taken the same time of the day.

*** All values are expressed as means ± s.e.m. GraphPad Prism 8 software was used to perform statistical analyses. All details of the statistical tests used are stated in the figure legends. Two-tailed Student’st-tests, two-tailed Mann–WhitneyU-tests and one-way ANOVA with two-tailed Tukey’s test were used as described in the figure legends. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare two groups over time. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Unless otherwise specified in the main text or figure legends, all experiments reported in this study were repeated at least two independent times.
