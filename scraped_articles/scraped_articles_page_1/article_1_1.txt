*** Eukaryotic innate immune systems use pattern recognition receptors to sense infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which then triggers an immune response. Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators, known as bacteriophages1,2,3,4,5,6. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have been found to sense only a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial pattern recognition receptors and their ligands7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46inEscherichia colican directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the notable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of antiphage defence systems that enables them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbour both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46during infection, and we demonstrate that such phages can fully evade CapRelSJ46defence only when both triggers are mutated. Our work shows how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow the detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defence systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.

*** A central facet of innate immunity is the use of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the activation of cell-intrinsic defence mechanisms12,13. In mammals, diverse PRRs recognize different PAMPs. Canonically, mammalian PRRs are thought to be specific for a single PAMP—for example, RIG-I binds double-stranded RNA, TLR4 binds LPS and TLR5 binds flagellin13. Human NAIP/NLRC4 recognizes three different ligands—bacterial flagellin and the needle and inner rod proteins of the type III secretion system—but a common structural motif is recognized in each protein14,15,16. Other eukaryotic restriction factors are also often specific for individual viral proteins17. Host immunity proteins and the pathogen-encoded molecules they bind often engage in Red Queen coevolutionary dynamics18. This dynamic is typically framed as a molecular arms race in which a single protein being sensed can acquire mutations to evade detection, leading to selective pressure on the host factor to mutate and restore the interaction.

*** The concept of PRRs and PAMPs extends to bacteria and their ability to detect infection by bacteriophages. Recent work indicates that bacteria harbour proteins analogous to PRRs that recognize certain phage proteins or nucleic acids during an infection, leading to the activation of various antiphage defence mechanisms7,8,9,10,11,19,20,21. There are only a handful of cases for which the direct trigger of an antiphage defence system is known, so the specificity of phage detection by bacterial PRRs is largely unknown. Individual defence systems have been reported to recognize only single ligands during phage infection. In addition, a screen for phages that escape various defence systems, an approach that can unveil phage-encoded PAMPs, primarily identified mutations in a single phage gene for each defence system examined7. These previous results suggest that bacterial PRRs, like most eukaryotic PRRs, also typically have one-to-one relationships with their phage-encoded triggers. However, the homologues of a given family of bacterial PRRs can sometimes recognize different PAMPs8, and one large-scale screen indicated that some bacterial defence proteins can be activated by the ectopic expression of multiple phage proteins19. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein, CapRelSJ46, directly binds and senses two completely unrelated and structurally different phage proteins using the same sensor domain. We find one phage that harbours both trigger proteins and demonstrate that they both activate CapRelSJ46during infection. Our results indicate that the Red Queen dynamic unfolding between bacteria and phages may not always involve a single PRR and a single ligand, but rather involve the complex coevolution of multiple factors.

*** We recently identified and characterized a fused toxin–antitoxin system called CapRelSJ46that protectsEscherichia coliagainst diverse phages11. CapRelSJ46contains an N-terminal toxin domain and a C-terminal antitoxin domain that normally binds and autoinhibits the N-terminal toxin. During infection by SECΦ27 phage, the newly synthesized major capsid protein (MCP) binds to the C-terminal domain of CapRelSJ46to relieve autoinhibition, leading to the activation of CapRelSJ46. Activated CapRelSJ46then pyrophosphorylates the 3′ end of transfer RNAs, which inhibits protein translation and restricts phage propagation11. Sensing the MCP, which is an essential and abundant component of the phage, is beneficial to the host bacteria because it limits the number of mutations that phages can acquire to escape defence. However, given intense selective pressure to maintain infectivity, phages can evolve to overcome defence through mutations in their capsid protein. For instance, a SECΦ27-like phage called Bas4 naturally encodes a single amino acid substitution in its MCP that prevents activation of CapRelSJ46, enabling the phage to escape defence11. Such escape may drive selection for mutations in CapRelSJ46that restore an interaction with the MCP. Alternatively, CapRelSJ46could, in principle, evolve to sense a different phage protein.

*** To explore whether CapRelSJ46can sense phage factors other than the MCP, we focused on a family of phages from the BASEL collection22that are closely related to SECΦ27, including Bas11. When CapRelSJ46was produced from its native promoter on a low-copy-number plasmid inE. coliMG1655, it decreased the efficiency of plaquing (EOP) of Bas11 by over 104-fold (Fig.1aand Extended Data Fig.1a), indicating that it had provided strong defence against Bas11. To identify the phage-encoded activator(s) in Bas11, we isolated spontaneous Bas11 mutants that largely overcome CapRelSJ46defence (Fig.1band Extended Data Fig.1b). Notably, although the MCP of Bas11 is highly similar (85% identical) to that of SECΦ27 (Extended Data Fig.1c), none of the Bas11 escape mutants mapped to its MCP. Instead, all six escaping phage clones contained mutations in the genomic region of gene54, which encodes a small hypothetical protein of 66 amino acids, Gp54Bas11(Fig.1b,c). Escape clones 1 and 2 each had a single nucleotide substitution that led to either a premature stop codon (W43*) or a single amino acid substitution (G24D) in Gp54Bas11. Clones 3 and 4 each contained a mutation immediately upstream of the gene54coding region, probably within its promoter (Fig.1c). Expression levels of Gp54Bas11from the mutated promoters were lower than that from wild-type promoter (Extended Data Fig.1d). Lastly, clones 5 and 6 each had a large deletion encompassing gene54and nearby genes (Fig.1c). These results suggested that loss-of-function mutations in gene54allow Bas11 to largely overcome CapRelSJ46defence. Notably, Gp54Bas11does not show any sequence similarity to the MCP of SECΦ27.

Purified hexahistidine (His6)- and maltose binding protein (MBP)-tagged CapRelSJ46(His6–MBP–CapRelSJ46) and either the wild-type or G24D variant of His6–Gp54Bas11were added to the reactions. Image shown is representative of three biological replicates.

*** We hypothesized that the wild-type phage protein Gp54Bas11may be an activator of CapRelSJ46, with the escape mutants enabling the phage overcome defence by preventing activation. To test whether Gp54Bas11is sufficient to activate CapRelSJ46, which blocks cell growth when active11, we coproduced either wild-type or a mutant variant of Gp54Bas11with CapRelSJ46in the absence of phage infection. Wild-type Gp54Bas11rendered CapRelSJ46toxic, whereas neither variant (W43* or G24D) had any effect on cell growth when coproduced with CapRelSJ46(Fig.1d). As a control, we verified that neither wild-type nor mutant variants of Gp54Bas11were toxic in the absence of CapRelSJ46(Extended Data Fig.1e).

*** We then tested whether Gp54Bas11can activate CapRelSJ46to inhibit protein translation in a reconstituted in vitro transcription–translation system. Incubation of purified His6–MBP–CapRelSJ46with purified His6–Gp54Bas11strongly inhibited the synthesis of a model protein, DHFR, whereas the G24D variant of Gp54Bas11had no effect (Fig.1e). We verified that the G24D variant was still properly folded because it had a circular dichroism spectrum comparable to the wild-type protein (Extended Data Fig.1f). Together, our results indicated that wild-type Gp54Bas11, like the previously identified MCP from phage SECΦ27, activates CapRelSJ46.

*** CapRelSJ46consists of a conserved N-terminal toxin domain that can pyrophosphorylate tRNAs and a C-terminal antitoxin domain containing a zinc-finger-like domain (pseudo-ZFD), flanked by α-helices referred to as anchors (Fig.2a). The antitoxin domain is highly variable among CapRel homologues (Extended Data Fig.2a) and largely determines the phage specificity of CapRel defence11. The antitoxin of CapRelSJ46directly binds the MCP of SECΦ27, serving as a phage infection sensor11. To test whether Gp54Bas11also interacts with CapRelSJ46to activate it, we immunoprecipitated CapRelSJ46–Flag from cells coproducing wild-type Gp54Bas11–HA or the G24D variant, having verified that tags did not affect protein functions (Extended Data Fig.2b). We found that wild-type, but not the G24D variant of, Gp54Bas11coimmunoprecipitated with CapRelSJ46(Fig.2b). In addition, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicated that purified Gp54Bas11directly binds CapRelSJ46with aKdof 800 nM in a 1:1 ratio (Fig.2c), comparable to that previously measured for MCPSECΦ27(350 nM)11. The interaction is entropically driven, suggesting either that the bound state is somewhat dynamic or that some region of the complex becomes disordered following binding. Binding affinity decreased at least 20-fold for the G24D variant of Gp54Bas11(Fig.2c).

*** To test whether Gp54Bas11is also sensed by the antitoxin domain of CapRelSJ46, we spotted Bas11 phages onto cells producing the homologue CapRelEbcfromEnterobacter chengduensisor a chimera that replaced most of the CapRelSJ46antitoxin with the corresponding region of CapRelEbc(Fig.2dand Extended Data Fig.2c). Unlike CapRelSJ46, neither CapRelEbcnor the chimera provided robust defence against Bas11 (Fig.2dand Extended Data Fig.2c), despite their abilities to protect against another phage, T7 (Extended Data Fig.2d). In addition, the chimeric version of CapRel was no longer toxic to cells when coproduced with wild-type Gp54Bas11(Fig.2e), and Gp54Bas11did not coprecipitate with the chimeric CapRel (Fig.2b). These results indicated that the antitoxin domain of CapRelSJ46is important for sensing Gp54Bas11, despite the lack of sequence similarity of Gp54 to the MCP from SECΦ27.

*** To further investigate how the antitoxin of CapRelSJ46senses Gp54Bas11, we mutagenized this domain through error-prone PCR and selected for CapRelSJ46mutants that were no longer activated by Gp54Bas11. The single substitutions N275D (Fig.3a), L270P and L276P (Extended Data Fig.3a) each largely abolished the toxicity of CapRelSJ46when coproduced with Gp54Bas11, and substantially weakened CapRelSJ46defence against Bas11 (Extended Data Fig.3b). Notably, these residues all lie within α-helix 9, which is part of anchor-1 in the antitoxin and is highly variable among CapRel homologues (Fig.2aand Extended Data Figs.2aand3c); thus, we hypothesized that α9, formed by residues 270–279, might be critical for the interaction of CapRelSJ46with Gp54Bas11. To further probe the role of anchor-1 in interacting with Gp54Bas11, we made substitutions in other non-conserved residues within α9 and tested their activation by Gp54Bas11. The substitutions K278E (Fig.3a), D273K and S279P (Extended Data Fig.3a) each reduced or abolished the toxicity of CapRelSJ46following induction of Gp54Bas11, supporting a key role for this helix in sensing Gp54Bas11.

Image shown is representative of two biological replicates.

*** To gain better structural insight into the interaction between CapRelSJ46and Gp54Bas11, we first solved a crystal structure of Gp54Bas11to 2.3 Å resolution (Fig.3band Extended Data Table1). This structure showed a small, six-stranded β-barrel with one prominent loop between β-strands β1 and β2; β-barrels with this topology are very rare in nature23. The closest structural homologues of Gp54Bas11are five-stranded β-barrel SH3 domains (DALIz-score of 3.8), with a 310α-helix replacing the additional β-strand (Extended Data Fig.3d). Thus, the structure of Gp54Bas11is significantly distinct from the AlphaFold-predicted structure of MCP from SECΦ27, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) greater than 14 Å (Extended Data Fig.3e).

*** Next, we determined the structure of a CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex to 2.2 Å resolution (Fig.3c, Extended Data Fig.4a–cand Extended Data Table1). This complex had ATP bound in the pyrophosphate donor site (Fig.3cand Extended Data Fig.4c), stacked between R79 and R116, similar to that of other RelA/SpoT homologue enzymes24,25, which indicated that the complex captures the active state of the enzyme. The complex structure showed that Gp54Bas11interacts with the pseudo-ZFD and anchor-1 of the antitoxin, with an interface of about 1,650 Å2that is partially overlapping, but largely distinct from, that formed between CapRelSJ46and MCPSECΦ27as predicted by AlphaFold and previously validated11(Fig.3cand Extended Data Fig.4d). In this triggered state, residue Y355 in CapRelSJ46, which is part of the YXXY motif that normally blocks the ATP-binding site in the closed state11, is tethered to Gp54Bas11β2 by K269 and cannot interact with the toxin domain (Extended Data Fig.4e). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex was compatible with the crystal structure and indicated, by comparison with the unbound CapRelSJ46, that Gp54Bas11effectively clamps the pseudo-ZFD to both anchors, precluding recoil toward the toxin active site (Extended Data Fig.4f,gand Extended Data Table2).

*** Each of the substitutions in CapRelSJ46identified above as affecting activation (Fig.3aand Extended Data Fig.3a,b) maps to the interface formed with Gp54Bas11(Fig.3dand Extended Data Fig.5a). In the complex, the hydrophobic core of the Gp54Bas11β-barrel binds to both the amphipathic anchor-1 and pseudo-ZFD of CapRelSJ46. In particular, G24, I25, S39, L41 and W43 of Gp54Bas11contact the pseudo-ZFD β-sheet, and W53 of Gp54Bas11becomes embedded between L270 and L276 of anchor-1 in CapRelSJ46and I29 and L31 of Gp54Bas11(Extended Data Fig.5a,b). The interface is further stabilized by a polar network between D273, N275, K278 and S279 from CapRelSJ46and Q47 and N50 from Gp54Bas11(Extended Data Fig.5a,b).

*** Notably, binding of Gp54Bas11to CapRelSJ46involves a significant topological rearrangement (Fig.3b,e). In the complex, the β-barrel of Gp54Bas11unfolds with β1 and β6 becoming disordered, consistent with the entropy-driven binding suggested by ITC (Fig.2c). Whereas Gp54Bas11β2–β5 bind on one side of the pseudo-ZFD of CapRelSJ46interacting with β7 and anchor-1, the long β1–β2 loop of Gp54Bas11folds into β-strand β1′ and binds on the other side, making contacts with β8 of the pseudo-ZFD and effectively clamping the pseudo-ZFD (Fig.3d,eand Extended Data Fig.4a). These interactions produce a ‘hybrid’ eight-stranded, antiparallel, twisted β-sheet comprising β-strands from both Gp54Bas11and CapRelSJ46that wraps around anchor-1 of CapRelSJ46(Fig.3d,eand Extended Data Fig.4a). In addition, binding by β1′ of Gp54Bas11to CapRelSJ46β8 moves the pseudo-ZFD further from the active site compared with the unbound open state of CapRelSJ46, which probably primes the enzyme to bind and modify target tRNAs (Extended Data Fig.5c). Finally, we noted that the N-terminal region of Gp54Bas11β1′ (and possibly the disordered N terminus) might also make contact with the cap of α10 (residues 314–317) in CapRelSJ46(Extended Data Fig.5d). Supporting the relevance of this interaction, we found that substitutions R314E and K316E, together with K278E, further reduced the toxicity of CapRelSJ46following induction of Gp54Bas11(Fig.3a).

*** To further validate the ordered-to-disordered transition of Gp54Bas11and binding interface of the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex, we used hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled with mass spectrometry for comparison of the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex with the unbound proteins. This analysis showed protection of anchor-1 and the pseudo-ZFD regions of CapRelSJ46, particularly of β7–β8 and α8–α10 (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.6a–d), which almost perfectly matched the crystallographic interface. We also observed an increase in deuterium uptake by anchor-2 (α11 and α12), which contains the YXXY motif that interacts with the toxin active site (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.6d). This deprotection reflects the opening of CapRelSJ46following binding of Gp54Bas11. On the Gp54Bas11side, both the newly formed β1′ and the β2–β4 region showed decreases in deuterium uptake, consistent with the crystal structure (Fig.3g). HDX mass spectrometry (HDX–MS) also showed an increase in uptake in the N- and C-terminal regions of Gp54Bas11(β1 and β6 in the unbound state), consistent with unfolding of the β-barrel following binding of CapRelSJ46and disorder in these regions in the crystal structure. Collectively, our results demonstrate that a dynamic, entropically favourable bound state drives the activation of CapRelSJ46by Gp54Bas11.

*** Importantly, the α-helix (α9) in anchor-1 of CapRelSJ46that makes extensive contacts with Gp54Bas11does not contribute significantly to the AlphaFold-predicted interface with MCPSECΦ27(Fig.3c). Thus, we hypothesized that the substitutions in this region of CapRelSJ46that disrupt activation by Gp54Bas11would not impact activation by MCPSECΦ27. To test this hypothesis, we coproduced our CapRelSJ46variants with MCPSECΦ27and found that the single substitutions N275D and K278E, as well as the triple substitution K278E/R314E/K316E, did not substantially affect activation by MCPSECΦ27despite their reduced activation by Gp54Bas11(Fig.3h). We also found that the N275D and K278E variants of CapRelSJ46coprecipitated with MCPSECΦ27as well as the wild-type CapRelSJ46, but, as expected based on the crystal structure (Fig.3c,d), had reduced binding to Gp54Bas11in this assay (Fig.3i).

*** Together, our results indicated that the antitoxin domain of CapRelSJ46is critical for sensing both the MCP of SECΦ27 and Gp54 from Bas11, with overlapping but not identical regions of the antitoxin involved in the two different interactions. More broadly, these findings show the notable versatility of a zinc-finger-like domain in recognizing different proteins, which enables sensing by a single bacterial defence protein of multiple phage-encoded activators.

*** Given that both the MCP of SECΦ27 and Gp54 from Bas11 can activate CapRelSJ46, we decided to examine a set of phages from the BASEL collection—Bas5, Bas8 and Bas10—that are closely related to SECΦ27 and Bas11 and encode homologues of both the MCP (Extended Data Fig.1c) and Gp54 (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.7a). The region of the MCP demonstrated in SECΦ27 to mediate an interaction with CapRelSJ46was nearly identical in each of these phages (Extended Data Fig.1c). When examining the Gp54 homologues, we noted that those from Bas11 and Bas10 were nearly identical, with only three amino acid differences, whereas the SECΦ27, Bas5 and Bas8 homologues contained more substitutions relative to Bas11 (Fig.4a).

*** We previously showed that CapRelSJ46can defend against Bas5 and Bas8, like SECΦ27, by sensing their MCPs11. The MCPs of Bas5 and Bas8 are sufficient to activate CapRelSJ46on their own, and mutations in the MCPs allowed the phages to escape defence11. Here we found that CapRelSJ46also defends against Bas10, reducing plaquing by around tenfold, and selection for complete escape led to the identification of clones producing a single amino acid substitution (I85T or I115F) in its MCP, MCPBas10(Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.7b). In addition, we found that wild-type MCP from Bas10, but not the I115F variant, caused toxicity in cells coproducing CapRelSJ46(Fig.4c). Notably, the same I115F substitution emerged when phage SECΦ27 was evolved to overcome CapRelSJ46defence11.

*** Our results indicated that the MCP of Bas10, like that of Bas5, Bas8 and SECΦ27, is necessary and sufficient to activate CapRelSJ46. However, these four phages also harbour homologues of the unrelated, alternative activator Gp54 from Bas11. We therefore tested whether the Gp54 homologues of these phages can also activate CapRelSJ46. However, none of the Gp54 homologues from SECΦ27, Bas5, Bas8 and Bas10 caused cellular toxicity when coproduced with CapRelSJ46(Fig.4d). These findings are consistent with our results demonstrating that mutations in the MCP-encoding gene of these phages enabled complete escape from CapRelSJ46defence. We concluded that phages SECΦ27, Bas5, Bas8 and Bas10 contain only a single protein activator of CapRelSJ46(their MCPs), despite encoding homologues of the Gp54 activator found in Bas11 phage.

*** This conclusion was most unexpected in regard to Bas10, which is the most closely related to Bas11 and encodes a homologue of Gp54Bas11containing only three amino acid differences (Fig.4a). To test the importance of these three residues for activation of CapRelSJ46by Gp54Bas11, we made three single substitutions (D6E, A7V or I25V) in Gp54Bas11to individually introduce the residues found at these positions in the Bas10 homologue. The substitutions A7V and I25V in Gp54Bas11each largely abolished its ability to activate CapRelSJ46when coproduced, whereas D6E had no effect (Fig.4e). We also made the reciprocal, individual substitutions (V7A or V25I) in the Bas10 homologue of Gp54 but found that neither substitution alone enabled activation of CapRelSJ46, whereas the double mutant was sufficient to activate (Extended Data Fig.7c). I25 is found in the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex interface, as is the adjacent G24 (Extended Data Figs.7dand5b). The substitutions I25V and G24D (identified as an escape mutant) probably disrupt binding and thereby abolish activation. By contrast, A7 is disordered in the complex but is part of the β-barrel core in unbound Gp54Bas11(Extended Data Fig.7e). The A7V substitution may have stabilized the unbound β-barrel, which would also have prevented activation by preventing the unfolding of Gp54Bas11.

*** The results presented thus far raised a conundrum: our escape mutant screen with Bas11 showed mutations only in gene54(Fig.1b) and Gp54Bas11was sufficient to activate CapRelSJ46(Fig.1d), but the MCP of Bas11 is identical to that of Bas10 in which the MCP is the sole trigger for CapRelSJ46. We revisited our Bas11 escape mutants and noted that each only partially escaped CapRelSJ46defence, with reduction of about 10- to 100-fold in EOP (Fig.1band Extended Data Fig.1b). Even the clone of Bas11 with a deletion of gene54(clone 5 in Fig.1b) still formed smaller plaques when spotted onto cells containing CapRelSJ46compared with cells with an empty vector (Fig.1b). We tried to evolve this mutant clone of Bas11 to completely overcome CapRelSJ46defence, and succeeded in isolating mutants that plaqued the same on CapRelSJ46-containing cells as empty vector cells (Fig.5aand Extended Data Fig.8a). Notably, whole-phage genome sequencing showed that all of our escape mutants produced an I115F substitution in the MCP, MCPBas11, in addition to the deletion of the gene54region (Fig.5a). As shown above, the wild-type MCP from Bas11 (which is identical to that of Bas10) was sufficient to activate CapRelSJ46and the substitution I115F completely ablated this activation (Fig.4c). We engineered wild-type Bas11 phage to encode only the I115F substitution in its MCP—that is, with gene54present—and observed that this substitution alone was also insufficient for Bas11 to completely escape CapRelSJ46defence with a tenfold reduction in EOP and smaller plaques (Fig.5band Extended Data Fig.8b). Thus, our results demonstrate that Bas11 encodes two activators of CapRelSJ46and that it can fully escape CapRelSJ46defence only when both activators are mutated.

*** Source Data

*** To further compare the activation of CapRelSJ46by the MCP and Gp54Bas11, we engineered phage SECΦ27 such that it encodes one or both proteins as activators. As shown previously, despite encoding a Gp54Bas11homologue (known as Gp19), wild-type SECΦ27 normally triggers CapRelSJ46only by its MCP, with a single substitution in the MCP (L114P) allowing the phage to completely escape defence. We replaced the coding sequence of the SECΦ27 homologue (Gp19) with that of Gp54Bas11in both wild-type SECΦ27 and the SECΦ27 MCP(L114P) escape phage (Fig.5c). When Gp54Bas11was introduced into SECΦ27 MCP(L114P) it restored CapRelSJ46-dependent defence, with a decrease of over 105-fold in EOP (Fig.5cand Extended Data Fig.8c). Defence against this phage, which uses Gp54Bas11as the activator of CapRelSJ46, was stronger than that against wild-type SECΦ27, which produces approximately 102-fold reduction in EOP and uses the MCP only to trigger CapRelSJ46(Fig.5cand Extended Data Fig.8c). However, we found that some clones of this engineered phage spontaneously escaped CapRelSJ46defence (Fig.5c). We isolated eight such clones that completely overcame defence and found that each harboured a mutation in the region encoding its activator Gp54Bas11(Fig.5d,eand Extended Data Fig.8d). Three clones had a single amino acid substitution (D6G, S39C or L41P) in Gp54Bas11, and these variants no longer activated CapRelSJ46(Extended Data Fig.8e). Notably, S39 and L41 are part of the hydrophobic pocket involved in interaction with CapRelSJ46(Extended Data Figs.8fand5b) in the crystal structure. D6 is disordered in the complex, so the D6G substitution may either disrupt an interaction not captured in the crystal structure or stabilize the unbound state of Gp54Bas11to prevent CapRelSJ46activation.

*** Finally, when Gp54Bas11was introduced to wild-type SECΦ27 such that both wild-type MCP and Gp54Bas11were present in the SECΦ27 genome, it led to a stronger defence phenotype (over 106-fold reduction in EOP) compared with phages encoding a single activator, and no spontaneous escape mutants were observed (Fig.5cand Extended Data Fig.8c). These results indicated that Gp54Bas11had functioned as a potent activator when introduced into a related phage SECΦ27, and harbouring both activators (Gp54Bas11and the MCP) in its genome rendered this phage extremely sensitive to CapRelSJ46defence, as with the native Bas11 phage. By sensing two activators encoded in a single phage genome, CapRelSJ46can provide strong defence and limit the ability of phages to escape defence.

*** Previously, we demonstrated that CapRelSJ46, a fused toxin–antitoxin system, providesE. coliwith robust antiphage defence by sensing the MCP of many phages11(Fig.5f). Here we discovered an additional protein trigger for CapRelSJ46in the phage Bas11. This alternative trigger, Gp54Bas11, is a small protein of 66 amino acids with unknown function. Despite lacking sequence and structural similarity to the MCPs, Gp54Bas11binds to the C-terminal antitoxin domain of CapRelSJ46and directly activates it, like the MCPs (Fig.5f). The interfaces used by the two protein activators overlap but also involve distinct regions. These findings highlight the versatility of a zinc-finger-like domain in interacting with multiple, structurally different proteins. Using such a promiscuous, yet still selective, domain as a phage-infection sensor enables a single defence protein to respond to more than one phage trigger.

*** Unlike the MCP, which is a conserved and essential structural element of the phage, Gp54Bas11is a small protein of unknown function that is not essential to phage Bas11 under laboratory conditions. Gp54Bas11might benefit the phage in the wild, possibly by inhibition of another defence system. Recent work has identified other small, non-essential phage proteins that activate one antiphage defence system while also inhibiting another. For example, the Ocr protein of phage T7 inhibits restriction–modification systems, but can also activate the PARIS defence system26,27,28.

*** Although it is often assumed that bacterial defence systems and their triggers will have one-to-one relationships, like most PRRs and PAMPs in eukaryotes, our work demonstrates that CapRelSJ46can directly and simultaneously—that is, during a single infection—detect two different proteins (MCP and Gp54Bas11) from phage Bas11 (Fig.5f). The detection of multiple phage factors is probably a common feature of bacterial immunity proteins. For instance, a high-throughput screen for bacteria-encoded triggers of an antiphage retron system identified multiple genes from prophages19. Each was sufficient, when overproduced, to trigger the retron, but whether they each contributed to activation during infection is unknown. Similarly, multiple phage proteins other than Ocr can stimulate the PARIS defence system following overexpression28. Phages can escape defence with mutations in genes encoding these proteins, but whether they bind directly and whether the binding is similar to or different from Ocr is not yet known28. Finally, individual phage mutants often provide incomplete escape from a given defence system7; although this may reflect the inability of single mutations to evade defence while still maintaining the phage gene’s function, it may also indicate that a second trigger exists. Some defence proteins may even detect more than two phage proteins. Indeed, CapRelSJ46protects against T-even phages that lack a homologue of Gp54Bas11and produce capsid proteins very different to those in Bas11 and SECΦ2711, indicating the existence of yet other triggers.

*** Detection of multiple triggers could render cells susceptible to ‘autoimmunity’ if a promiscuous defence protein is inadvertently triggered by any related, host-encoded proteins in the absence of an infection. Notably though, at least for CapRelSJ46, the phage proteins being sensed do not share close relatives in bacterial genomes. Detection of phage proteins without closely related host proteins may be a key feature of bacterial immunity, but how defence proteins balance the sensitivity of detection with the risk of autoimmunity remains to be studied. Sensing of multiple proteins may offer at least three advantages to the immune system: (1) for phages that produce multiple triggers, the immunity system can provide stronger defence than if it had sensed only one protein; (2) dual sensing makes it more difficult for the phage to completely evade defence unless both triggers are mutated; and (3) sensing of multiple phage proteins may enable protection against a broader set of phages, some of which encode only one trigger or the other. Given these advantages, we anticipate that many antiphage defence systems have evolved similar versatility and also directly sense multiple proteins. Some eukaryotic restriction factors may also sense multiple, unrelated proteins. For instance, TRIM5α, which directly binds retroviral capsid proteins, may also bind the capsid proteins of some DNA viruses29,30,31; and MxA may bind diverse, structurally dissimilar nucleoproteins from RNA viruses32,33. The sensing of multiple viral proteins in bacteria or eukaryotes probably leads to complex coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their viral predators (Fig.5g). The Red Queen dynamic underpinning host–pathogen relationships is often portrayed as the successive coevolution of two interacting proteins17, but may involve multiple proteins stemming from many-to-one relationships between triggers and immunity proteins.

*** All bacterial and phage strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table1.E. colistrains were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria broth (LB) medium for cloning and maintenance. Phages were propagated by infecting a culture ofE. coliMG1655 at an optical density (OD600) of around 0.1–0.2 and multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Cleared cultures were pelleted by centrifugation to remove residual bacteria and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Chloroform was then added to phage lysates for prevention of bacterial growth. All phage-infection experiments were performed in LB medium at 25 °C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations (liquid, plates): carbenicillin (50, 100 μg ml−1); chloramphenicol (20, 30 μg ml−1).

*** All plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table2, and all primers in Supplementary Table3.

*** Wild-type or mutant variants of gp54Bas11were PCR amplified from the corresponding wild-type Bas11 or escaping phage clones using primers TZ-3 and TZ-4, and inserted into pBAD33 linearized with TZ-1 and TZ-2 using Gibson assembly. To add a C-terminal HA-tag, primers TZ-9 and TZ-10 were used to PCR amplify pBAD33-gp54Bas11followed by Gibson assembly. Mutations that produce the single amino acid substitutions D6E, A7V and I25V in Gp54Bas11were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers TZ-38–43.

*** Mutations that produce the single amino acid substitutions N275D, D273K, K278E and S279P were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers TZ-11–18. Mutations that produce the triple substitution K278E/R314E/K316E were introduced by two-step, site-directed mutagenesis using primers TZ-23–24, then TZ-15 and TZ-16. To add a C-terminal FLAG-tag to CapRelSJ46, primers TZ-25 and TZ-26 were used to PCR amplify pBR322-capRelSJ46followed by Gibson assembly.

*** The genes encoding Gp54Bas11homologues (Gp57Bas10, Gp60Bas8, Gp57Bas5and Gp19SECΦ27) were PCR amplified from the corresponding phage using primers TZ-30–37 and inserted into linearized pBAD33 by Gibson assembly. Mutations that produce the single amino acid substitutions V7A and V25I in Gp57Bas10were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers TZ-44–47.

*** Either wild-type or the G24D variant of gp54Bas11was PCR amplified from the corresponding phage using primers TZ-7 and TZ-8, and inserted into pET-His6vector linearized with primers TZ-5 and TZ-6 using Gibson assembly.

*** capRelSJ46was first PCR amplified from pBR322-capRelSJ46using primers TZ-48 and TZ-49, and inserted into pET-His6vector linearized with primers TZ-5 and TZ-6 using Gibson assembly. The gene encoding MBP was PCR amplified with TZ-52 and TZ-53, and inserted into pET-His6-capRelSJ46linearized with primers TZ-50 and TZ-51 using Gibson assembly.

*** The gene encoding the MCP of Bas10 (Gp9Bas10) was PCR amplified from phage Bas10 using primers TZ-27 and TZ-28, and inserted into pBAD33 linearized with primers TZ-29 and TZ-1 using Gibson assembly.

*** gp54Bas11with its native promoter was PCR amplified from phage Bas11 using primers TZ-58 and TZ-59, and inserted into pBR322-capRelSJ46-Flag linearized with primers TZ-60 and TZ-61 using Gibson assembly. Corresponding upstream mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis.

*** Plasmids described above were introduced intoE. coliMG1655 by TSS transformation or electroporation.

*** Bas11 mutant phage producing MCP(I115F) was generated using a CRISPR–Cas system for targeted mutagenesis as described previously34. In brief, sequences for RNA guides used to target Cas9-mediated cleavage were designed using the toolbox in Geneious Prime 2022.0.2 and selected for targeting of mcpBas11(Gp8 in Bas11), but nowhere else in the Bas11 genome. Guides were inserted into the pCas9 plasmid and tested for their ability to restrict Bas11. An efficient guide was selected and the pCas9-guide plasmid was cotransformed intoE. coliMG1655 with a high-copy-number repair plasmid containing mcpBas11(I115F), with the guide mutated synonymously to prevent self-cutting. The wild-type Bas11 phage was plated onto a strain containing both the pCas9-guide and the repair plasmid, and single plaques were screened by Sanger sequencing. Two clones that produce the I115F-substituted MCPBas11were propagated on strains containing only pCas9-guide for further selection.

*** SECΦ27 mutant phages producing Gp54Bas11rather than its homologue in SECΦ27 (Gp19) were generated as described above. The guide was selected such that it targeted only gene19in SECΦ27, but not gene54from Bas11. The selected pCas9-guide plasmid was cotransformed intoE. coliMG1655 with a high-copy-number repair plasmid containing the coding sequence of gene54from Bas11, flanked by the region that flanks gene19in SECΦ27 for homologous recombination. Either the wild-type SECΦ27 phage or the mutant producing MCP(L114P) was plated onto the strain containing pCas9 plasmid and the repair plasmid for selection. Two clones each were propagated and selected twice on strains containing only pCas9-guide.

*** Phage-spotting assays were conducted similarly to a method described previously11. Phage stocks isolated from single plaques were propagated inE. coliMG1655 at 37 °C in LB. To titre phage, dilutions of stocks were mixed withE. coliMG1655 and melted LB + 0.5% agar, spread on LB + 1.2% agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. For phage-spotting assays, 80 μl of a bacterial strain of interest was mixed with 4 ml of LB + 0.5% agar and spread on an LB + 1.2% agar + antibiotic plate. Phage stocks were then serially diluted in 1× FM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4), and 2 μl of each dilution was spotted on the bacterial lawn. Plates were then incubated at 25 °C overnight before imaging. EOP was calculated by comparing the ability of the phage to form plaques on an experimental strain relative to the control strain. Experiments were replicated three times independently, and representative images are shown.

*** Bacterial toxicity assays were conducted similarly to a method described previously11. For coproduction of CapRelSJ46with either Gp54 homologues or MCPs, single colonies ofE. coliMG1655 harbouring pBR322-capRelSJ46and pBAD33-gp54 homologue or pBAD33-mcp (wild-type or the corresponding variants) were grown for 6 h at 37 °C in LB-glucose to saturation. Next, 200 μl of each saturated culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000gfor 10 min, washed once in 1× PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of 1× PBS. Cultures were then serially diluted tenfold in 1× PBS and spotted on M9L plates supplemented with 0.4% glucose or 0.2% arabinose. M9L plates contain M9 medium (6.4 g l−1Na2HPO4-7H2O, 1.5 g l−1KH2PO4, 0.25 g l−1NaCl, 0.5 g l−1NH4Cl medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, 2 mM MgSO4and 0.1 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 5% LB (v/v). Plates were then incubated at 37 °C overnight before imaging.

*** Bas11 or SECΦ27 MCP(L114P) escape mutants were isolated by plating a population of phage onto CapRelSJ46-containing cells. Next, 20 µl of 1010PFU ml−1Bas11 or SECΦ27 MCP(L114P) phage, mixed with 40 µl of overnight culture ofE. coliMG1655 pBR322-capRelSJ46, was added to 4 ml of LB + 0.5% agar and spread onto LB + 1.2% agar. Plates were incubated at 25 °C overnight. Single plaques were isolated and propagated using the same strain in LB at 25 °C. Amplified phage lysates were pelleted to remove bacteria, and sequenced by Illumina sequencing as described below to identify mutations.

*** Bas10 or Bas11 phage with gene54deleted was evolved to completely overcome CapRelSJ46defence using an experimental evolution protocol described previously35. In brief, five independent populations were evolved in a 96-well plate containing a sensitive hostE. coliMG1655 pBR322-EV and a resistant hostE. coliMG1655 pBR322-capRelSJ46. One control population was evolved with only the sensitive host. Overnight bacterial cultures were back-diluted to an OD600of 0.01 in LB, and 100 μl was seeded into each well. Cells were infected with tenfold serial dilutions of Bas10 or Bas11 phage with gene54deleted, at multiplicity of infection 100–10−4, with one well uninfected to monitor for contamination. Plates were sealed with breatheable plate seals and incubated at 25 °C for either 14 h (for Bas10) or 17 h (for Bas11) in a plate shaker at 1,000 rpm. Cleared wells from each population were pooled, pelleted at 4,000gfor 20 min to remove bacteria and supernatant lysates were transferred to a 96-deep-well block with 40 µl of chloroform added to prevent bacterial growth. Lysates were spotted onto both sensitive and resistant hosts to check the defence phenotype. Three rounds of evolution were performed for Bas10, and four populations were able to overcome CapRelSJ46defence. Two rounds of evolution were performed for Bas11 phage with gene54deleted. Evolved clones from each evolved population were isolated by plating to single plaques on lawns of resistant host, and control clones from the control population were isolated on a lawn of the sensitive host. Two clones from each population were propagated using the corresponding host and sequenced as described below.

*** Phage DNA extraction and sequencing were conducted as described previously11. To extract phage DNA, high-titre phage lysates (over 106PFU µl−1) were treated with DNase I (0.001 U µl−1) and RNase A (0.05 mg ml−1) at 37 °C for 30 min, then 10 mM EDTA was used to inactivate the nucleases. Lysates were then incubated with Proteinase K at 50 °C for 30 min to disrupt capsids and release phage DNA, which was isolated by ethanol precipitation. In brief, sodium acetate pH 5.2 was added to 300 mM followed by 100% ethanol to yield a final volume fraction of 70%. Samples were incubated at −80 °C overnight, pelleted at 21,000gfor 20 min and supernatant removed. Pellets were washed with 100 µl of isopropanol and 200 µl of 70% (v/v) ethanol, then air-dried at room temperature and resuspended in 25 µl of 1× TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Concentrations of extracted DNA were measured by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

*** For preparation of Illumina sequencing libraries, 100–200 ng of genomic DNA was sheared in a Diagenode Bioruptor 300 sonicator water bath for 20 × 30 s cycles at maximum intensity. Sheared gDNA was purified using AMPure XP beads, followed by end repair, 3′ adenylation and adaptor ligation. Barcodes were added to both 5′ and 3′ ends by PCR with primers that anneal to the Illumina adaptors. The libraries were cleaned by AMPure XP beads using a double cut to elute fragment sizes matching the read lengths of the sequencing run. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq at the MIT BioMicro Center. Illumina reads were assembled to the reference genomes using Geneious Prime 2022.0.2.

*** Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were conducted similarly to those described previously11. For coproduction of CapRelSJ46and Gp54Bas11or with MCPSECΦ27,E. coliMG1655 containing pBR322-capRelSJ46or pBR322-capRelSJ46-Flag (wild-type or mutant variants) and pBAD33-gp54Bas11-HA (wild-type or mutant variants) or pBAD33-mcpSECΦ27-HA were grown overnight in M9-glucose. Overnight cultures were back-diluted to an OD600of 0.05 in 50 ml of M9 (no glucose) and grown to an approximate OD600of 0.3 at 37 °C. Cells were induced with 0.2% arabinose for 30 min at 37 °C, then OD600was measured and cells pelleted at 4,000gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and cells resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche), 1 μl ml−1Ready-Lyse Lysozyme Solution (Lucigen) and 1 μl ml−1benzonase nuclease (Sigma). Samples were lysed by two freeze–thaw cycles, and lysates normalized by OD600. Lysates were pelleted at 21,000gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and 750 μl of supernatant was incubated with prewashed anti-Flag magnetic agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, followed by the direct addition of 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol to beads to elute proteins. Samples were boiled at 95 °C, analysed by 4–20% SDS–PAGE and transferred to a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Anti-Flag and anti-HA antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at a final concentration of 1:1,000, and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher) was used to develop blots. Blots were imaged by the ChemiDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). Images shown are representatives of two independent biological replicates.

*** Single colonies ofE. coliMG1655 pBR322-gp54Bas11-Flag with its wild-type or mutant native promoter were grown overnight in LB. Overnight cultures were back-diluted to OD600of 0.05 in 10 ml of fresh LB and grown to OD600of 0.4 at 37 °C. OD600was measured, and 5 ml of cells pelleted at 4,000gfor 5 min with OD600normalized. Supernatant was removed and pellets resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were then boiled at 95 °C and analysed using 4–20% SDS–PAGE and transferred to a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Anti-Flag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-RpoA antibody (BioLegend) were used at a final concentration of 1:1,000, and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher) was used to develop blots. Blots were imaged using a ChemiDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). Images shown are representative of two independent biological replicates.

*** The C terminus of CapRelSJ46was mutagenized using error-prone PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously11. In brief, primers TZ-54 and TZ-55 were used to amplify the C terminus of CapRelSJ46using Taq polymerase (NEB), with 0.5 mM MnCl2added to the reaction as the mutagenic agent. PCR products were treated with Dpn I, column purified and inserted into a pBR322-capRelSJ46backbone amplified with primers TZ-56 and TZ-57 using Gibson assembly. Gibson products were transformed into DH5α and grown overnight in LB at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were miniprepped to obtain the mutagenized library, and individual colonies were Sanger sequenced to assess the number of mutations. To perform selection, the mutagenized library was electroporated intoE. coliMG1655 pBAD33-gp54Bas11and plated onto M9L plates containing 0.2% arabinose to select for survivors. Colonies were picked and sequenced to identify mutations in CapRelSJ46.

*** For the production of His6-MBP-tagged CapRelSJ46,E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-His6-MBP-capRelSJ46and grown in LB medium to OD600= 0.5. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells grown for 3 h at 30 °C. The culture was centrifuged at 4,000gfor 10 min at 4 °C and the cell pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.4 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1lysozyme and 7.5 U ml−1benzonase nuclease (Millipore). Cells were disrupted using sonication (Qsonica), and glycerol was added to the lysate at a final 10% concentration following sonication. The supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 30 min, JA-25.50 rotor, Beckman Coulter). The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a gravity-flow chromatography column (Bio-Rad) packed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 15 ml of lysis buffer. The resin was washed with ten column volumes of wash buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) and then with ten column volumes of wash buffer 2 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Proteins were eluted in 4 ml of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 300 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). For removal of any remaining contaminants, the eluted protein sample was loaded onto a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in SEC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and concentrated to around 1 mg ml−1. Purity of protein samples was assessed both spectrophotometrically and by SDS–PAGE.

*** To produce His6-tagged Gp54Bas11or the G24D variant,E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-His6-gp54Bas11(wild-type or G24D) and grown in LB medium to an OD600of 0.5. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were grown for 3 h at 30 °C. Purification steps were performed similarly to those described above, with the following buffers. Lysis buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2and 1 mM DTT supplemented with 0.4 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1lysozyme and 7.5 U ml−1benzonase nuclease (Millipore). Wash buffer 1 contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Wash buffer 2 contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Elution buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 300 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. To remove any remaining contaminants, the eluted protein sample was loaded onto a SEC Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in SEC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and concentrated to around 5 mg ml−1. Purity of protein samples were assessed both spectrophotometrically and by SDS–PAGE.

*** Experiments using the PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit (NEB, E6800) were performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All reactions were supplemented with 0.8 U µl−1RNase Inhibitor Murine (NEB, M0314S). Purified His6-MBP-tagged CapRelSJ46protein was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 500 nM, and either purified His6-tagged Gp54Bas11or the G24D variant was used at a final concentration of 4 µM. A template plasmid encoding the control protein DHFR (provided by the kit) was used at 6 ng µl−1. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and 2 µl of each reaction was mixed with 10 µl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol. Mixtures were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and analysed by 12% SDS–PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie stain and imaged using the ChemiDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad).

*** His6-tagged Gp54Bas11was purified as described above and concentrated to 5 mg ml−1for crystallization. Crystallization conditions for His6–Gp54Bas11were screened by sitting-drop vapour diffusion using a Formulatrix NT8 drop setter and commercial screening kits. Each drop, consisting of 100 nl of protein solution plus 100 nl of reservoir solution, was equilibrated against 70 µl of reservoir solution. Crystals appeared in Index HT (Hampton Research) condition B12 (2.8 M sodium acetate trihydrate pH 7.0). These conditions were optimized, and the final crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapour diffusion, with drops consisting of 2 µl of protein plus 2 µl of well solution (3.2 M potassium acetate pH 7.0) at room temperature. After 8 days, a crystal was harvested and directly vitrified in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryostream). X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku Micromax-007 rotating anode with Osmic VariMax-HF mirrors and a Rigaku Saturn 944 detector. Diffraction data were processed with the XDS suite36. Phaser37was used to solve the structure by molecular replacement using an AlphaFold38model. The molecular replacement solution was refined in PHENIX39with manual model building done with Coot40. The model was refined to a finalRwork/Rfreeof 0.211/0.252. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table1.

*** For the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex, CapRelSJ46and Gp54Bas11were purified as described above and mixed in a 1:1 ratio at a concentration of 2 mg ml−1. The complex was then further purified by SEC (in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2and 1 mM DTT) and the resulting sample concentrated to 10 mg ml−1for crystallization. Crystallization conditions for the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex were either screened as such or supplemented with 5 mM ATP. Crystals grew within 1 week in 25% PEG 1500 in a malic acid, MES, Tris buffer system (pH 8.0). Before data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in the mother liquor solution supplemented with 25% glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the I24 beamline of the Diamond Light Source synchrotron (UK) on a CdTe Eiger2 9M detector, then processed using the XDS suite36and scaled with Aimless. The structure was solved by molecular replacement performed with Phaser37using the coordinates of the toxSYNTH domain of CapRelSJ46(PDB:7ZTB). Initial automated model building was performed with Buccaneer41, which partially completed Gp54Bas11and further improved with the MR-Rosetta suite from the Phenix package42. Following several iterations of manual building with Coot40and maximum-likelihood refinement as implemented in Buster/TNT43, the model was refined toRwork/Rfreeof 0.193/0.236. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table1.

*** CapRelSJ46homologues were identified, aligned and used as input for ConSurf analysis as described previously11. Homologues of the MCPs or Gp54Bas11in BASEL phages were identified by BLASTp44searches against each phage genome, and aligned by MUSCLE45. Whole genomes of phages were aligned using Mauve46in Geneious Prime 2022.0.2.

*** The structure prediction of CapRelSJ46-MCPSECΦ27was reported previously11and was calculated using AlphaFold2. The structure of CapRelSJ46in the closed state for comparison with the experimental SAXS curve was also calculated using AlphaFold2 using default parameters (as implemented in ColabFold38) and running the calculations for ten recycles. Both models are deposited in the ModelArchive Database (https://www.modelarchive.org) with the accession codes ma-zblch (https://doi.org/10.5452/ma-zblch) and ma-9z23e (https://doi.org/10.5452/ma-9z23e).

*** Circular dichroism measurements were performed on a MOS-500 spectropolarimeter (BioLogic) using a cuvette of 0.1 cm path length. Spectra were collected between 200 and 250 nm with a data interval of 0.25 nm at 25 °C. Measurements were recorded in 15 mM K2HPO4, 0.05 mM KH2PO4pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Protein concentration used in measurements was 0.6 mg ml−1. Molar residue ellipticities (θ, mdeg cm2dmol−1) were obtained from the raw data (θ, ellipticity) following buffer correction, according to the relation [θ] =θMw(ncl), whereMwis weight-averaged molecular mass,cmass concentration,loptical path length andnthe number of amino acid residues.

*** Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX–MS) experiments were performed on an HDX platform comprising a Synapt G2 mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation) connected to a nanoAcquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system following the protocol previously described11. Samples of CapRelSJ46, Gp54Bas11and CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11were prepared at a concentration of 100 µM (the integrity of the complex was confirmed by SEC before the HDX–MS experiment). For each experiment, 8 µl of sample was incubated for 1, 5, 15 and 60 min in 72 µl of labelling buffer L (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 0.002% mellitic acid, pD 7.5) at 20 °C. Non-deuterated reference points were prepared by replacement of buffer L with equilibration buffer E (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 0.002% mellitic acid, pH 7.5). After labelling, samples were quenched by mixing with 80 µl of prechilled quench buffer Q (50 mM K2PO4, 1 mM TCEP, 1.2% formic acid, pH 2.4). Samples were then directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stocked at −80 °C until injection. For injection, samples were thawed at room temperature and 150 µl of quench samples directly transferred to a Enzymate BEH Pepsin Column (Waters Corporation) at 200 µl min−1and 20 °C, with a pressure 3,000 pounds per square inch. Peptic peptides were trapped for 3 min on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 VanGuard Pre-column (Waters Corporation) at a flow rate of 200 µl min−1in water (0.1% formic acid in high-performance liquid chromatography water, pH 2.5) before elution on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 Column for chromatographic separation. Separation was performed with a linear gradient buffer (3–45% gradient of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 40 µl min−1. Peptide identification and deuteration uptake analysis were performed on a Synapt G2, using positive electrospray ionization, data independent acquisition, and triwave ion-mobility for improved resolution and identification. Leucine enkephalin was applied for mass accuracy correction, and sodium formate was used as calibration for the mass spectrometer. MSE data were collected with a 20–30 V transfer collision energy ramp. The pepsin column was washed between injections using pepsin wash buffer (1.5 M guanidinium HCl, 4% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.8% (v/v) formic acid). A cleaning run was performed on every third sample to prevent peptide carryover. Optimized peptide identification and peptide coverage for all samples were performed from undeuterated controls (five replicates). All deuterium time points were performed in triplicate. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium by the PRIDE47partner repository with the dataset identifierPXD050526.

*** Samples for small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were concentrated to 10 mg ml−1, flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. SAXS data were collected at the SWING beamline (Soleil and ESRF synchrotrons, France) on a Pilatus 2M detector using the standard beamline set-up in SEC mode. Samples were prepared in 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM TCEP and 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5. SEC–SAXS was performed with a Shodex KW404–4 F column coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatography system, in front of the SAXS data collection capillary. Samples were flowed at 0.2 ml min−1and data collected at 10 °C. Radiation-damaged frames were removed before data analysis. Data were analysed with the ATSAS suite48. SAXS-based models were derived from the coordinates of the X-ray structure of the CapRelSJ46–Gp54Bas11complex and an AlphaFold model of unbound CapRelSJ46. Calculation of ab initio shapes was carried out with the program DAMMIF from the ATSAS package.

*** All titrations were performed with an Affinity ITC (TA instruments) at 30 °C. For titration, CapRelSJ46was loaded in the instrument syringe at 200 µM and Gp54Bas11used in the cell at 10 µM. Titrations were performed in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2and 1 mM TCEP. Final concentrations were verified by absorption using a Nanodrop One (ThermoScientific). All isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed by titrating 2 µl of CapRelSJ46into Gp54Bas11(Gp54Bas11(G24D) was used at 260 µM) at a constant stirring rate of 75 rpm. All data were processed, buffer corrected and analysed using the NanoAnalyse and Origin software packages.
