*** The prevailing dogma for morphological patterning in developing organisms argues that the combined inputs of transcription factor networks and signalling morphogens alone generate spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. However, metabolism has also emerged as a critical developmental regulator1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, independent of its functions in energy production and growth. The mechanistic role of nutrient utilization in instructing cellular programmes to shape the in vivo developing mammalian embryo remains unknown. Here we reveal two spatially resolved, cell-type- and stage-specific waves of glucose metabolism during mammalian gastrulation by using single-cell-resolution quantitative imaging of developing mouse embryos, stem cell models and embryo-derived tissue explants. We identify that the first spatiotemporal wave of glucose metabolism occurs through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to drive fate acquisition in the epiblast, and the second wave uses glycolysis to guide mesoderm migration and lateral expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucose exerts its influence on these developmental processes through cellular signalling pathways, with distinct mechanisms connecting glucose with the ERK activity in each wave. Our findings underscore that—in synergy with genetic mechanisms and morphogenic gradients—compartmentalized cellular metabolism is integral in guiding cell fate and specialized functions during development. This study challenges the view of the generic and housekeeping nature of cellular metabolism, offering valuable insights into its roles in various developmental contexts.

*** The formation of a body plan from a simple multicellular structure occurs during gastrulation, the essential process of embryogenesis. Localized morphogen signals guide cell-fate decisions and behaviours to shape the embryo, but the precise mechanisms by which these critical signals integrate at the correct time and place to mediate gastrulation morphogenesis are not fully understood. The remarkable fidelity of this process indicates that multiple regulatory layers ensure robust embryonic patterning.

*** To explain how an organism can establish positional identity during development and regeneration, a ‘gradient theory’—whereby graded metabolism along an embryonic axis directs tissue patterning and morphogenesis—was first experimentally introduced in 1915 (refs.11,12. Although this model had been challenging to incorporate into a mechanistic framework, it is now supported by the recent conceptualization of metabolic signalling, in which metabolic enzymes and metabolites themselves function beyond bioenergetics to actively modulate or instruct cellular and developmental programmes13. Studies have shown regionalized glycolytic gradients in chick and mouse embryos, indicating that glycolysis can function independently of energy production during the development of various tissues1,2,3,6,9,10and stem cell differentiation4,5. Despite these insights, questions remain about whether the mammalian embryo indeed processes nutrients uniformly, how metabolic signalling might be linked to morphogen signalling pathways, and how these signals are integrated to modulate broader cell function during early post-implantation morphogenesis. Moreover, although it is known that glycolysis is enhanced after implantation, high glucose uptake does not necessarily lead to increased utilization in the glycolytic pathway; instead, it can also redirect glucose into parallel, glycolysis-independent pathways.

*** Challenges to simultaneously probe metabolic and morphogen signalling kinetics at the single-cell level in live early embryos has hindered efforts to understand how these pathways might work together to support complex differentiation and morphogenetic events. Here we delineate the instructive role of cellular metabolic activity in the temporal and spatial coordination of mouse gastrulation in developing embryos, with support from in vitro stem cell and embryo-derived tissue explant models. We find that a single nutrient, glucose, is used selectively through different metabolic pathways to instruct both local and global embryo morphogenesis, in a cell-type and stage-specific manner. Specifically, we identify two spatiotemporally resolved waves of glucose uptake that start in early post-implantation epiblast cells at the onset of mouse gastrulation. This graded metabolic activity extends distally in epiblast tissue as development progresses, and re-emerges within the mesenchymal cells as they exit the primitive streak and migrate laterally within the mesodermal wings. We find that these glucose-mediated events are coupled to high ERK activity, but are distinctly regulated in each wave, suggesting a critical connection between glucose metabolism and ERK signalling that drives successful tissue patterning during mammalian gastrulation. Collectively, our integrated examination of metabolic and signalling axes provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms that guide gastrulation, one of the most fundamental and evolutionarily conserved stages of animal life.

*** During implantation, the mammalian embryo adopts a heavy reliance on glucose to support rapid morphological changes, proliferation and differentiation14. How this metabolic shift aligns with the evolving landscape of post-implantation embryogenesis remains unclear. We first analysed in utero-dissected mouse embryos for expression of the canonical glucose transporter GLUT1, and performed a glucose-uptake analysis using the fluorescent glucose analogue (2-NBDG). Both GLUT1 protein expression and the ratiometric 2-NBDG signal revealed compartmentalized glucose uptake in two distinct regions: first within the small population of posteriorly positioned epiblast cells destined to form the primitive streak that we term ‘transitionary epiblast’, and second within the lateral mesodermal wings, which develop as cells exit the primitive streak to form migratory mesenchyme (Fig.1a–cand Extended Data Fig.1a–c). Notably, cells within the primitive streak exhibited no or minimal glucose (2-NBDG) uptake, concomitant with a gradual reduction in GLUT1 expression as cells entered the streak (Fig.1band Extended Data Fig.1a–c).

Epiblast is indicated by white dashed lines; primitive streak is indicated by green dashed lines. Scale bars, 40 µm.

*** To analyse how this regionalized surge of glucose uptake evolves, we analysed the temporal sequence of gastrulation through three streak stages: early streak (ES; embryonic day 6.25 (E6.25)–E6.5), mid-streak (MS; E6.5–6.75) and late streak (LS; E6.75–7.25) (Fig.1d). This spatiotemporal analysis revealed two distinct waves of glucose activity. In the first ‘epiblast wave’, we observed an anteroposterior gradient of glucose uptake, originating in the posterior-proximal-most transitionary epiblast cells at gastrulation onset. As gastrulation proceeded and the primitive streak developed distally, this pattern of glucose activity expanded within the epiblast tissue towards the anterior-distal axis, directly preceding primitive streak elongation (Fig.1d,eand Extended Data Fig.2a–d). Cells switch back to a glucose-dependent programme after exiting the primitive streak, with high metabolic activity observed in mesenchyme as they expanded laterally, marking the onset of the second ‘mesodermal wave’ of glucose activity (Fig.1b,cand Extended Data Fig.1a,b). This spatial distribution was also reflected in the expression pattern of another canonical glucose transporter, GLUT3 (Fig.1fand Extended Data Fig.2b,c).

*** We then performed label-free live imaging of NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H), an endogenous auto-fluorescent readout of glycolytic activity15, via multiphoton microscopy in TCF/LEF:H2B-GFP-reporter developing gastrulas (Methods). This showed that NAD(P)H intensity was also intrinsically graded over the course of gastrulation and localized to epiblast cells anterior to the expanding primitive streak population of mesoderm progenitors (Fig.1g). This NAD(P)H intensity gradient overlapped with regions of 2-NBDG uptake, confirming the specificity of this assay in imaging the metabolic activity of live gastrulas (Extended Data Fig.2e).

*** Finally, we probed a spatial transcriptome dataset of the mouse gastrula16for key genes involved in glucose metabolism. Transcripts such asSlc2a1,Gpi1,PfkbandLdhbfrom the glycolysis pathway, as well asOgtandGnpnat1from the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP; a branch of glucose metabolism), were graded within epiblast and mesodermal wings during progressive stages of gastrulation (Extended Data Fig.2f).

*** These observations suggested finely tuned spatiotemporal metabolic regulation during gastrulation, potentially influencing both cell-fate determination and morphogenetic processes.

*** The spatiotemporal pattern of glucose uptake observed in epiblast cells preceding primitive streak expansion led us to investigate the role of glucose metabolism in preparing these cells for streak entry. To assess this, we treated ex vivo developing mouse embryos with inhibitors that target different enzymatic steps of glucose metabolism (Fig.2a). In these perturbation experiments, gastrulas were collected at the ES stage (around E6.5), at which point embryos had already broken symmetry and initiated primitive streak formation (see pre-culture control in Fig.2b), and subsequently cultured for 12–18 h with selective inhibitors to define effects on primitive streak progression.

*** Source Data

*** First, to block all glucose-dependent pathways, we used 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and 3-bromopyruvate (BrPA), competitive inhibitors of hexokinase and glucose phosphate isomerase (Fig.2a). After 18 h, control embryos advanced through post-gastrulation stages, forming double mesoderm wings, whereas gastrulas treated with 2-DG and BrPA were significantly delayed, with most not progressing past the LS stage (Extended Data Fig.3a–c). Shorter (12 h) treatments revealed that inhibiting the entirety of glucose metabolism by treatment with 2-DG and BrPA significantly impaired distal elongation and development of the primitive streak, suggesting that epiblast cells need glucose metabolism for mesodermal transition (Fig.2b).

*** We next targeted each major branch of glucose metabolism to clarify the specific metabolic pathway(s) responsible for the primitive streak-specific phenotype. This effect was recapitulated with azaserine, an inhibitor that blocks the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate, the rate-limiting step that links glucose metabolism to HBP (Fig.2a,b). Concentration-response analysis, wherein the degree of pathway inhibition is indirectly assessed using the primitive streak developmental phenotype as a readout, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect under 2-DG or azaserine inhibition (Extended Data Fig.3d). Azaserine yielded a bimodal response, indicating heterogeneous sensitivity among the treated embryos, potentially owing to differences in cell state or temporal developmental dynamics (Extended Data Fig.3d). By contrast, blocking glycolytic enzymes that bypass the HBP branch—which we refer to as ‘late-stage-glycolysis’ components—with YZ9 (targeting PFKFB3) or shikonin (targeting pyruvate kinase M2) had no effect on primitive streak progression (Fig.2a,band Extended Data Fig.3e). Similarly, inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase (galloflavin), pentose phosphate pathway (6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN)) and ATP synthase (oligomycin) also did not affect streak development (Fig.2band Extended Data Fig.3e).

*** To further confirm on-target effects of the inhibitors and to functionally test glucose dependency in the epiblast, we performed rescue experiments by culturing embryos in various nutrient-supplemented or nutrient-sparse media. Some embryos cultured in medium devoid of glucose, pyruvate and glutamine showed defects in primitive streak development, similar to those treated with 2-DG and BrPA (Extended Data Fig.3f). Selectively reintroducing glucose or glutamine improved primitive streak elongation, whereas pyruvate did not, suggesting the importance of non-glycolytic glucose metabolism branches (Extended Data Fig.3f). Although all groups maintained a SOX2+epiblast, SOX2 expression levels remained lower in the glutamine-reintroduced condition17(Extended Data Fig.3f). Additionally, galactose supplementation, which bypasses inhibition by 2-DG and BrPA by conversion to glucose-6-phosphate and restoring carbon flux to HBP (Fig.2a), rescued primitive streak development in both inhibitor-treated and nutrient-sparse conditions (Fig.2b). Finally, neither 2-DG and BrPA nor azaserine treatments impeded cell proliferation within developing embryos, confirming stable growth and bioenergetics (Extended Data Fig.3g).

*** As the highly conserved HBP metabolic branch generates substrates that are important for protein post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and the attachment ofN-acetylglucosamine18,19(GlcNAc), this points to the possibility that glucose uptake in epiblast cells during early primitive streak induction might have critical roles that transcend bioenergetics. Overall, these findings underscore the critical importance of glucose metabolism in the developing epiblast, functioning through the HBP, in supporting cell-fate transitions required for primitive streak formation during early mouse gastrulation.

*** To support these in vivo findings, and to confirm the primary metabolic effect on epiblast patterning during mesodermal fate acquisition in isolation from interactions with other tissues, we utilized stem cell-based embryo models. Gastruloids (3D aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells20,21) treated with 2-DG did not specify mesoderm-like cells, and exhibited reduced expression ofT(which encodes Brachyury) and incomplete elongation (Extended Data Fig.4a).Sox2was retained across groups, whereasEtv4, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF)–ERK target gene involved in mesoderm specification22, was downregulated under 2-DG treatment (Extended Data Fig.4b). Gastruloids under YZ9 treatment, which blocks late-stage-glycolysis, developed normally, highlighting that the role of glucose metabolism in mesoderm specification is independent of the late-glycolysis branch.

*** We also treated mouse extraembryonic endoderm (mXEN) cells for 24 h with the same metabolic inhibitors used on embryos (Fig.2a). None of these inhibitors affected endodermal identity (indicated by GATA6 expression) or proliferation (marked by histone H3 phosphorylation) (Extended Data Fig.4c). Although potential differences between in vitro XEN cells and in vivo visceral endoderm cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that glucose metabolism does not have tissue-autonomous roles in endoderm, despite GLUT1 expression and 2-NBDG uptake in the visceral endoderm (Extended Data Fig.2d). Oligomycin-treated mXEN cells showed reduced proliferation (Extended Data Fig.4c), and active mitochondrial labelling in live gastrulas revealed significant accumulation within the visceral endoderm layer (Extended Data Fig.4d). This indicates a preference for oxidative phosphorylation endodermal cells, in line with previous evidence23.

*** We next performed mesoderm-directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. We applied selective inhibitors from day 1 to day 4 to target epiblast-to-mesoderm transition state, or from day 3 to day 4 to target cells that had predominantly already reached the mesodermal state (Extended Data Fig.5a). Consistent with our findings in embryos and gastruloids, 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine treatments significantly disrupted the transition of mouse embryonic stem cells from epiblast-like stem cells (EpiLSCs) to mesoderm states (days 1–4), whereas late-stage glycolysis-specific inhibition with YZ9 had no effect (Extended Data Fig.5a,b). Between day 1 and day 4, mouse embryonic stem cell colonies treated with 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine grew in size over time but maintained high expression of pre-patterned epiblast genes (Sox2,Rex1andKlf2) and low expression of mesoderm genes (T,Eomes,Mesp1andPdgfra) compared with controls (Extended Data Fig.5a,b,d). Conversely, treatment duration targeting cells that had already reached the mesodermal state (days 3–4) did not yield significant phenotypic differences, and mesoderm-differentiated cells continued to blanket the plates on which they were cultured, similar to control conditions (Extended Data Fig.5a,b). None of the inhibitors or treatment durations induced cell death (Extended Data Fig.5c).

*** FGF signalling via ERK activation has a vital role in mouse gastrulation for the specification of mesoderm24,25, and has been linked to glucose activity in the presomitic mesoderm of developing chick embryos late in gestation6. To compare the effects of glucose metabolism inhibition with that of signalling inhibition on the early mesoderm fate transitions, we applied the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 during mesoderm-directed-differentiation assays. This revealed overlapping phenotypes between inhibition of these signals and inhibition of HBP, with significantly low levels of mesodermal genes and high levels of pre-differentiation epiblast genes (Extended Data Fig.5a–d), suggesting an interplay between glucose metabolism via HBP and cellular signalling in mesoderm specification during gastrulation.

*** These results support the idea that glucose metabolism via the HBP is essential for epiblast cells to acquire a stable mesodermal identity. Although glucose uptake may have additional non-tissue-autonomous roles in in vivo endodermal lineages, our 3D gastruloid and mesoderm-directed-differentiation assays suggest that the observed embryo phenotypes result primarily from the effect on epiblast and primitive streak derivatives.

*** Given the high level of glucose activity in epiblast cells before primitive streak entry (Fig.1b), we investigated whether a metabolic regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during mouse gastrulation. In utero-dissected embryos exhibited GLUT1-rich posterior epiblast cells adjacent to the intact laminin+basement membrane, with strong MMP14 co-expression, suggesting that glucose uptake may be involved in basement membrane breakdown, which is essential for EMT and epiblast cell ingression into the primitive streak (Fig.2cand Extended Data Fig.6a,b). Transitionary epiblast cells, in which E-cadherin (also known as ECAD) expression was weaker, exhibited GLUT1 and GLUT3 activity, indicating that enhanced glucose uptake spans the early-stage EMT (Extended Data Fig.6c). Additionally, reanalysis from single-cell RNA sequencing of E6.5 to E8.5 mouse embryos26revealed upregulation of genes encoding rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes (Eno1,Gapdh,Ldha,Slc2a1andSlc16a3) at the onset of EMT, whereas expression of Krebs cycle genes (Aco2,Mdh2,SdhaandSdhb) remained stable (Extended Data Fig.6d).

*** We next treated embryos with 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine. These treatments inhibited basement membrane breakdown, an outcome that, notably, could be significantly rescued by supplementation with GlcNAc (the end product of HBP) (Fig.2d). By contrast, late-stage glycolysis inhibitors, ATP synthase blockers, lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors and pentose phosphate pathway inhibitors, had no such effect on basement membrane (Fig.2d).

*** We then utilized an in vitro proteolytic activity assay using GFP-tagged DQ gelatin, a substrate that fluoresces at sites of proteolytic digestion27. To correlate our assay with the post-implantation epiblast state that undergoes EMT, we examined differentiating-EpiLSC colonies during their transition to mesoderm (schematic in Extended Data Fig.5a). In control groups, the presence of many GFP+EpiLSC clusters indicated regions on the plate where cells were actively transitioning to mesoderm via the local release of matrix metalloproteases27(Fig.2e). Treatment with 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine resulted in an absence of GFP signal, indicating that aberrant glucose metabolism, specifically HBP branch inhibition, functionally impairs the process of EMT (Fig.2e)—a result similar to that of ERK inhibition (PD0325901 treatment)25(Extended Data Fig.7a). Finally, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses during embryonic stem cell-to-mesoderm differentiation showed a significant reduction in the expression of distinct EMT genes after treatment with 2-DG and BrPA, includingCdh2(which encodes NCAD),Mmp2andVim(Extended Data Fig.7b).

*** Together, these findings show that early EMT in the mouse epiblast is closely linked to glucose metabolism through HBP, demonstrating how intracellular shifts in glucose flux can directly modulate cellular and molecular regulatory networks to primarily control fate decisions of epiblast cells and, secondarily, allow their subsequent ingression into the primitive streak. Anterior epiblast cells are influenced by the anterior visceral endoderm, which prevents posteriorization and inhibits EMT. Thus, the shift of glucose activity to anterior regions at later stages (Fig.1d) is likely to reflect a move toward ectoderm fate, as these cells show prolonged glucose metabolism4.

*** ERK (ERK1 and ERK2) signalling—a critical downstream pathway activated by various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)—has an essential role in mesoderm specification and gastrulation cell movements in vertebrates, including mice24,25,28,29,30,31. It has been suggested that blocking protein-modifying enzymes that utilize substrates from glucose metabolism can impair RTK function32,33. Thus, we next investigated the effect of the glucose-uptake waves on ERK signalling during mouse gastrulation.

*** We found high levels of diphosphorylated ERK (dpERK) in transitionary epiblast cells and the newly formed mesodermal layer (Extended Data Fig.7c), correlating with glucose-uptake patterns (Fig.1b). The amount of dpERK was reduced in embryos treated with 2-DG and BrPA, indicating a functional link between glucose metabolism and ERK signalling (Extended Data Fig.7c). Western blots confirmed decreased pERK levels in EpiLSCs treated with 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine, whereas total ERK levels remained unchanged (Fig.3aand Supplementary Fig.1). PD0325901- or SU5402-treated embryos mimicked the developmental delays seen with 2-DG and BrPA treatment (Extended Data Fig.7d,e), suggesting a potential coupling of glucose activity and signalling.

*** To obtain a quantitative real-time readout for ERK signalling activity, we used ERK kinase translocation reporter (KTRmClover) mouse embryonic stem cells34,35,36in a tetraploid complementation assay37,38(Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.8a). Live imaging showed a graded pattern of increased cytoplasmic localization of KTR along the anteroposterior axis in the epiblast, indicative of active ERK (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.8a–c) that resembled our previously defined glucose-uptake pattern (see Fig.1). Simultaneous label-free live imaging of ERK-KTRmCloveralongside NAD(P)H activity in embryos with multiphoton microscopy showed a skewing of NAD(P)H signal anteriorly to the site of active KTRmClover, supporting our hypothesis that the wave of glucose metabolism precedes ERK signalling dynamics within the gastrulating embryo (Extended Data Fig.8c).

*** Expectedly, inhibition of ERK (PD0325901) or FGFR (SU5402) each decreased cytoplasmic ERK signal with no clear nuclear and cytoplasmic distinction, or higher nuclear signal, both indicative of low ERK activity (Extended Data Fig.8d). HBP inhibition, using either 2-DG and BrPA or azaserine, also reduced cytoplasmic ERK signal in epiblast cells, again showing no clear distinction between nuclear and cytoplasmic regions (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.8e). Notably, GlcNAc supplementation into the azaserine-containing culture medium restored active ERK signal in the epiblast, as indicated by increased cytoplasmic KTR localization (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.8e). These results collectively support the idea that the wave of glucose uptake and HBP flux in epiblast tissue may be essential for functional ERK-mediated signal transduction.

*** Having observed the capability of GlcNAc, an HBP-specific metabolic intermediate, to rescue both primitive streak formation and ERK signalling in azaserine-treated embryos (Figs.2dand4cand Extended Data Fig.8e), we next aimed to gain a mechanistic insight into how this regulation occurs and its roles within the epiblast. RTK signalling in mammalian cells, including embryos, relies on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which function as co-receptors by regulating morphogen retention, stability and extracellular diffusion32,33,39. These HSPGs are composed of core proteins and their tethered heparan sulfate chains, which are synthesized from repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and, notably, GlcNAc. To assess HSPG formation in HBP-inhibited embryos, we first examined expression of the heparan sulfate chain 10E4. Control embryos showed expected 10E4 expression within the basal side of epiblast cells, visceral endoderm and mesoderm26, and after HBP inhibition, embryos had globally reduced, albeit not eliminated, levels of 10E4 compared with controls (Extended Data Fig.8f). The HSPG cell surface-tethered core protein syndecan-1 showed higher expression within cell surface areas of epiblast cells that seemingly undergo mesenchymal transition, as well as visceral endoderm and mesoderm26, and it was also globally decreased under treatment with 2-DG and BrPA or with azaserine (Extended Data Fig.8f).

*** We next treated embryos with sodium chlorate (NaClO3)—a proteoglycan sulfation inhibitor that is known to affect HSPG and morphogen binding39,40. In NaClO3-treated embryos, expression of 10E4 and syndecan-1 was reduced (Extended Data Fig.8f). Notably, these embryos showed a reduced ERK signal (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.8e) and mirrored the HBP-inhibited embryo morphology of defective primitive streak development (Extended Data Fig.8h). Finally, we confirmed these observations in ERK-KTRmCloverdifferentiating-EpiLSC colonies, which revealed a significant reduction in ERK activity in cells treated with PD0325901, azaserine, 2-DG and BrPA or NaClO3(Fig.4dand Extended Data Fig.8g). Finally, we attempted to rescue the HBP-inhibited embryo phenotype with supplementation with FGF2, FGF4 and FGF8, with the logic that ligand supplementation would only be able to restore normal development if ERK signalling can function independently of HSPGs. FGF ligand supplementation did not rescue this phenotype in both embryos and cells (Fig.4dand Extended Data Fig.8h). Although this does not rule out the possibility that ERK activity in the epiblast is responsive to a RTK other than FGFR, it reflects similar observations from previous studies32,39.

*** Together, these findings provide compelling evidence for a role of the direct link between HBP, HSPG and ERK activity within epiblast during gastrulation to initiate the mesodermal fate acquisition.

*** Our observations reveal that both epiblast and mesodermal wings exhibit compartmentalized glucose uptake as the embryo progresses through temporal sequences of gastrulation (Fig.1and Extended Data Fig.1). After establishing the role of the first glucose-uptake wave in the epiblast to specify primitive streak, we next examined the function of glucose metabolism in mesenchymal cells that are exiting the primitive streak.

*** Consistent with our findings on the second wave of glucose metabolism in the mesenchyme (Fig.1b), we observed high GLUT3 expression in the NCAD+mesoderm wings (Extended Data Fig.9a). We then examined whether there is still a relationship between glucose metabolism and ERK signalling in the differentiated mesoderm, as seen in the epiblast. To investigate this, we first differentiated ERK-KTRmClovermouse embryonic stem cells to mesoderm and inhibited glucose metabolism (with 2-DG and BrPA), HBP (with azaserine) and ERK signalling (with PD0325901). Inhibitor treatments were limited to 2.5 h on day 4 of differentiation, when cells were in a stable mesoderm state to avoid confounding the role of HBP in the transition (Extended Data Fig.5a). Live imaging revealed the expected significant ERK inactivation with PD0325901 treatment (Fig.4e,f). Notably, inhibition of glucose metabolism (2-DG and BrPA) also caused significant ERK inactivation, but this was not attributed to the HBP, as azaserine-treated cells retained ERK activity (Fig.4e,f). We functionally validated this by maintaining directed-differentiating mesoderm cells in glucose, pyruvate and glutamine-free medium for 6 h, after which ERK signal was only reactivated after the re-addition of glucose (Fig.4g).

*** This suggests that glucose metabolism is differentially regulated in epiblast and mesodermal tissues across the embryo. Just as the activity of a morphogen can vary in various developmental contexts, we speculate that glucose utilization may also vary to guide distinct processes during gastrulation. Our data suggest that whereas initial glucose utilization through HBP is crucial for ERK signalling in the epiblast, indicating hierarchical regulation, glucose metabolism appears to correlate with ERK signalling through a different, perhaps less direct, mechanism once cells are committed to the mesodermal fate.

*** During gastrulation, FGF–ERK activity occurs in two temporal waves: first in posterior epiblast cells before primitive streak ingression, and then during mesenchymal migration24,28,29. Activated through various RTKs, this pathway controls fate transitions in the posterior epiblast and localizes within the mesodermal precursors to facilitate mesodermal commitment and their anterior migration away from the primitive streak. The FGFR1 mutant phenotype of mouse gastrulas was previously shown to display posterior build-up of cells in the primitive streak, interpreted as a migratory failure of mesoderm progenitors to exit the streak25,31or an impaired mode of cell ingression41,42.

*** In line with these observations, when we treated mouse gastrulas with SU5402 (FGFR inhibitor) or PD0325901 (ERK inhibitor) around E6.75, we observed a similar primitive streak-specific phenotype (Extended Data Fig.9b). Notably, our data support a close interaction between HBP and ERK signalling in the epiblast tissue, however, embryos under HBP inhibition did not phenocopy the primitive streak build-up observed in SU5402- or PD0325901-treated embryos (Extended Data Fig.9b). Whereas embryos, gastruloids and mesoderm-directed-differentiation assays comprehensively showed no specific effect of YZ9 treatment (to inhibit rate-limiting enzymes of the latter steps of glycolysis) on mesoderm specification and primitive streak elongation (Fig.2band Extended Data Figs.4aand5a,b), quantification of the primitive streak–mesoderm surface area in sagittal sections of YZ9- or PD0325901-treated gastrulas showed a significant increase in these embryos (Extended Data Fig.9b–e). These results suggest that whereas the HBP is involved in guiding cell-fate transitions within the epiblast, the HBP is not critical for cells once they ingress into the streak and specify toward mesoderm. Instead, late-stage glycolytic enzymes may become important when cells adopt a stable mesodermal fate and begin their lateral migration away from the midline of the embryo (Extended Data Fig.9c). Increased numbers of phospho-histone H3-expressing cells within the primitive streak were observed in YZ9- or PD0325901-treated embryos (Extended Data Fig.9f,g), but not in those treated with both drugs (Extended Data Fig.9g,h). Finally, we observed that ERK inhibition via PD0325901 treatment led to increased glucose uptake into mesodermal wings at late-stage gastrulation (E7.5) (Extended Data Fig.9i). Although this seemingly mesoderm-specific mechanism that suggests a relationship between ERK signalling and late-stage glycolysis would support previous observations in chick development6, future work examining the precise connection between the latter steps of glycolysis and ERK signalling would be beneficial to understand these phenomena.

*** Guided by these data, we next investigated whether later glycolysis steps might influence mesoderm-specific cellular behaviours, such as motility. Indeed, YZ9- or PD0325901-treated embryos demonstrated reduced migration distance of SNAI1+lateral mesoderm compared with controls (Extended Data Fig.10a).

*** To study this further, we isolated mesoderm explants from E7.25/7.5 embryos at the late streak-to-no bud stage using TCF/LEF:H2B-GFP reporter mice, and cultured them on fibronectin-coated dishes for 24 h ex situ (Fig.4a). The explant surface expansion during ex situ culture showed a significant decrease with global glucose metabolism inhibition (2-DG and BrPA), indicating impaired cell migration from the explant centre (Extended Data Fig.10b). However inhibition of ERK (PD0325901), late glycolysis (YZ9) or HBP (azaserine) did not result in a significant difference in the explant surface area expansion compared with controls (Extended Data Fig.10b). Quantifying cell movements through time-lapse live imaging revealed an increase in proliferation rate, but decreased cell displacement after PD0325901 and YZ9 treatments (Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.10c). This indicates that explant expansions in PD0325901 and YZ9 groups were driven primarily by increased cell divisions, rather than actual migration. This further confirms the expanded primitive streak sizes of PD0325901 and YZ9-treated embryos (Extended Data Fig.9b–g) are likely to be a combined result of increased proliferation and aberrant migration. Azaserine-treated explants did not show these effects, suggesting again that HBP is not required for mesodermal cell migration post-streak (Fig.4band Extended Data Fig.10c). Explants treated with 2-DG and BrPA showed reduced migration without increased proliferation (Fig.4b), possibly because the combination of 2-DG and BrPA affects multiple branching glucose metabolism pathways (Fig.2a), which may mitigate proliferative effects.

*** To functionally test whether glycolytic pathway inhibition affects mesodermal cell migration, we explanted mesoderm tissue isolated from wild-type embryos on FITC–fibronectin, a fluorescent substrate that reveals fluorescence-devoid regions where migratory mesenchymal cells have extended their protrusions to degrade the underlying extracellular matrix43(Fig.4c). This invadopodia assay showed significantly less substrate degradation in explants treated with 2-DG and BrPA, YZ9 or PD0325901, but no difference in those treated with azaserine, indicating that late glycolysis and ERK signalling affect mesoderm migration, whereas the HBP is decoupled from this process (Fig.4c). Immunolabelling under late glycolysis inhibition demonstrated upregulation of the adhesion marker ECAD (Fig.4d) with retention of the mesenchymal markers NCAD, EOMES and LEF1 (ref.44) (Extended Data Fig.10d,e), similar to previous observations in FGF-mutant embryos25.

*** Finally, we performed RNA sequencing on mesoderm explants treated with PD0325901 or YZ9 ex situ. Pathway enrichment analysis identified differentially expressed genes and revealed a downregulation of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway terms, including ‘focal adhesion’, that have direct roles in cell migration45, as well as ‘ECM–receptor interaction’ and ‘MAPK signalling pathway’ (Fig.4e). Differential GO (Gene Ontology) term analysis showed that significantly downregulated processes were similar between late-stage glycolysis and ERK-inhibited groups, including essential aspects of mesoderm function such as focal adhesion and integrin signalling (Extended Data Fig.10f).

*** Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that late-stage glycolysis in established mesoderm regulates the cell movements crucial for successful triploblastic development of mouse embryos.

*** Mammalian embryos undergo a conserved metabolic shift to glucose metabolism at the time of implantation, which was historically assumed to present a uniform metabolic phenotype across spatial and temporal scales with the same metabolic pathways employed over different tissues. However, our findings reveal that this glucose shift is critically fine-tuned to drive distinct cell differentiation and morphogenetic processes that control gastrulation. Our data demonstrate a preference for sugar processing and differential metabolic reliance within specific tissues of the embryo—when these specific metabolic requirements are not met, crucial morphogenetic processes are hindered (Fig.4f). Increasing in vitro evidence links metabolism with cell fate. Our work now demonstrates that metabolic changes can both phenocopy and rescue cell signalling defects that impair key developmental processes in vivo, revealing a novel perspective that glucose metabolism is not only ‘life-sustaining’, but also ‘life-directing’ during early embryogenesis.

*** Indeed, advances in experimental methods such as carbon tracing and improved ex vivo embryo culture have highlighted the potential instructive role of metabolism in embryogenesis8,10. Consequently, the concept of metabolic guidance during development has gained momentum, and recent findings have revitalized interest in the ‘gradient theory’ that was first proposed in the early twentieth century11. Our work expands on this theory to explain how metabolic gradients shape developmental processes. In a broad context, we demonstrate how the selective use of a single nutrient interacts with molecular signalling networks during development, which supports a more integrative, metabolite-guided, view of embryogenesis. ‘Metabolic signalling’ offers a useful paradigm for understanding how the entire body plan is established during early development, a time when a semblance of organismal identity is first acquired.

*** Mechanistically, our study uncovers a link between distinct glucose metabolism branches and signalling regulation. HBP, a nutrient-sensing pathway, produces UDP-GlcNAc, which is essential for HSPG biosynthesis and post-translational modifications that are vital for cell-fate transitions32,33,46,47. Our observations that ERK signalling follows glucose uptake in epiblast cells and is rescued by GlcNAc supplementation, alongside HBP inhibition reducing HSPG expression, underscore the role of UDP-GlcNAc in signalling transduction in epiblast tissue. Indeed, while this initially preprinted manuscript48was under revision, a study using mouse gastruloids as an in vitro system revealed that mannose, a glucose epimer, is essential for glycosylation during mesoderm specification and axial elongation7. Two additional recent studies that utilized 2-DG treatment in mouse gastruloids and derivative trunk-like structures49,50have also highlighted the role of glucose metabolism in modulating cellular signalling7,49and in facilitating proper neural and mesodermal formation50. These findings support our conclusions regarding the effect of glucose on epiblast cell-fate transitions.

*** We provide a holistic view of early embryonic development in a living organism, demonstrating that compartmentalized glucose usage varies depending on the developmental context and the cell types involved. The specifics of how ERK signalling interacts with glucose metabolism steps, whether through post-transcriptional modifications by HBP18,19, regulation of glycolytic transcripts6or a combination of both, remain to be explored further. Future studies could explore crosstalk between ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm lineages during late gastrulation or after gastrulation, especially considering the global reduction in SDC1 and 10E4 expression in HBP-inhibited embryos in our data. Although our experiments show that general mesenchymal migratory dynamics are HBP-independent, HBP may have other roles in mesoderm, such as migration directionality or final migratory location, that we did not investigate. It is also conceivable that carbon sources from other substrates, such as glutamine or fatty acids (both of which feed into HBP) could become preferred by committed mesenchymal cells to influence cellular behaviour.

*** Signalling ligands such as FGF8 and FGF4 that localize to the primitive streak, node and mesodermal tissues during the post-implantation period are crucial for regional cell-type specification and gastrulation patterning. Our findings suggest that compartmentalized activity of glucose metabolism provides necessary intermediates for cells to respond to key morphogens, indicating a synergistic relationship between glucose metabolism and signalling activities in embryonic regions. The differentiation from epiblast to mesoderm is likely to be driven by the combined influence of the cells’ metabolic status and the presence of specific signalling ligands, which together induce mesodermal fate. Thus, the interplay between localized metabolic activity and signalling not only supports, but actively directs, the epiblast to mesodermal transition.

*** Future research will benefit from current advancements and certain limitations of our study. Chemical inhibitors offer rapid control, mitigating embryonic lethality typically linked with genetic metabolic perturbations. However, predicting system-level effects of specific metabolic reaction inhibition remains challenging. Our study lacks quantitative data that precisely measures the degree of inhibition achieved by these inhibitors, primarily owing to difficulties in conducting metabolic flux analyses in post-implantation mammalian embryos at cell- and tissue-level resolution. Potential partial inhibition might trigger compensatory cellular responses that are not present under complete inhibition, possibly explaining some variability in our results. Despite these challenges, our study establishes dose–response relationships that demonstrate different degrees of the same phenotype, reinforcing the view that the observed effects are consistent and significant regardless of inhibition level. Our findings align with existing literature validating the efficacies of these inhibitors, and we demonstrate their specificity through in vivo functional rescue experiments and identify tissue-specific effects using stem cell and tissue explant models. As single-cell and spatial metabolomics become more feasible, future research is likely to provide deeper insights into metabolic processes and their implications for developmental biology and related fields.

*** As the saying goes, the best-laid plans of mice (and humans) can often go awry. In the context of developmental biology, our findings can offer crucial insights into how the body plan is created during early life, and the mechanisms behind developmental lethality that arise from deregulated signals and perturbed metabolism. These results underscore the importance of metabolism for embryonic patterning and developmental success, and are highly applicable to other contexts in which cellular transitions and migration take place, such as cancer biology and regeneration.

*** No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

*** Mice were maintained in accordance with national and international guidelines. All experimentation involving animal subjects was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale School of Medicine and conducted following the approved animal handling protocol (protocol no: 2023-20352). All experimental mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions on a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle temperature-controlled facility (between 20–26 °C and humidity 30–70%) with free access to water and food, and used from 6 weeks of age. All mice were bred to a mixed CD1 albino background. V. Greco provided the H2B-GFP:Tcf-LEF51reporter mouse line.

*** To collect in vivo embryos at gastrulation stage, 5- to 7-week-old female CD1 mice were naturally mated with 12- to 24-week-old male CD1 mice and sacrificed 6.5, 6.75, 7.0 or 7.25 days post coitum. Uteri were recovered and embryos were dissected from deciduae in DMEM medium containing 5% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 1× Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco) warmed up to 37°. The sex of the embryos was not determined.

*** Embryos were cultured in a 1:1 ratio of DMEM F/12 (Gibco) to rat serum (Envigo), with 1× Glutamax (Gibco), 0.2× Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco), and 0.2× MEM NEAA (Gibco) in 37 °C at 20% O2and 5% CO2. Medium was equilibrated in 5% CO2for ≥15 min prior to culture.

*** Mouse embryos at the pre-implantation 2-cell stage (E1.5) were recovered in KSOM medium by flushing the oviduct, from 5- to 6-week-old CD1 females that were superovulated by injection of 10 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (ProSpec) followed by 10 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) after 48 h and were mated with CD1 males. Two-cell-stage embryos were then fused to induce tetraploidy using BTX Embryo Manipulation Electro Cell Fusion System. Fused embryos were transferred to advanced KSOM (Sigma) covered with mineral oil (FUJIFILM) and cultured to blastocyst stage until embryonic stem cell injection. Each host tetraploid blastocyst was injected with 10–15 mouse ES cells, the injected blastocysts were transferred into uterus of the prepared day 2.5 CD1 pseudopregnant surrogates (6 weeks old) which were plugged by vasectomized CD1 male mice. These mouse embryonic stem cell-derived embryos were collected at the certain developmental timeline for subsequent experiments by uterine dissection (as described above).

*** Chemical inhibitors were administered as follows except where otherwise stated: 2 mM 2-DG52(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 20 µM BrPA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 10 µM PD0325901 (StemCell Technologies), 10 µM SU5402 (StemCell Technologies), 200 µM galloflavin53(Cayman Chemical), 100 µM oligomycin54A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 µM 6-AM55(Cayman Chemical), 10 µM YZ98(Cayman Chemical), 5 µM shikonin56(Cayman Chemical) and 5 µM azaserine57(Cayman Chemical or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Embryos were treated for 4 h, 7 h, 12 h or 18 h. Mesoderm explants were treated for 3 h, 12 h or 16 h. Stem cells were treated for the duration of the experiment as indicated in the figure captions. The proteoglycan sulfation inhibitor NaClO3(Sigma) was applied at 20 mM. FGF2, FGF4 and FGF8 (all Peprotech) were applied at 50 ng ml−1.

*** Nutrient-sparse medium was prepared using an Advanced DMEM/F-12 medium devoid ofd-glucose,l-serine,l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Caisson Laboratories) with the addition of 25 mM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 0.2× penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 0.2× MEM NEAA (Gibco). This was supplemented with the following nutrients, according to each experimental condition: 17 mM glucose (Gibco), 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and/or 1× Glutamax (Gibco). For galactose rescue experiments 20 mM galactose (Sigma) supplemented to the culture medium. For GlcNAc rescue experiments 1 mM or 2 mM GlcNAc (Sigma) supplemented to the culture medium. All embryos were cultured in a 1:1 ratio of customized DMEM and rat serum (Envigo).

*** All mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured at 37 °C in 20% O2and 5% CO2and passaged once they had reached 80% confluency. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. Mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured on gelatinized tissue-culture–grade plates in FBS-containing DMEM medium with 2i/LIF (1 μM MEK inhibitor PD0325901, 3 μM GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021 and 10 ng ml−1 LIF). FBS-containing DMEM (Gibco) medium comprised of: 18% inactivated FBS (Gibco), 1.2× penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 1.2× Glutamax (Gibco), 1.2× MEM NEAA (Gibco), 1.2 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and 120 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco). The ERK-KTR mouse embryonic stem cells used in this study were sourced from Simon et al.34(JAX 035333).

*** For in vitro mouse gastruloid experiments, we followed the protocol as described20,21. Gastruloids were treated with indicated drugs culture day between 3 and 4 and fixed for subsequent HCR staining or qPCR assay, as described in Dingare et al.7.

*** For in vitro mesoderm-directed differentiation experiments, we followed the protocol as described58, with some modifications. Cells were passaged (day 0) after reaching 80% confluency into 6-well culture plates or 8-well µ slides (Ibidi) at a density of 20,000 per cm2in FBS-containing DMEM medium with 10 ng ml−1Fgf2 (R&D Systems). Cells were treated at day 1 with 10 ng ml−1FGF2, at day 2 with 10 ng ml−1FGF2 and 5 µM CHIR99021 (StemCell Technologies), and at day 3 and 4 with 5 µM CHIR99021. Drug treatments added to the culture at least 12 h after FGF2 treatment was started on day 1, or on when cells transitioned to mesoderm state on day 3.

*** For mesoderm isolation from E7.25 mouse embryos, we followed a modified protocol as described59. Embryos were collected as described above. Extraembryonic tissue proximal to the amnion was removed, and the cup-shaped embryo was transferred to a dissociation medium consisting of 0.5% Trypsin EDTA (Gibco) and 2.5% Pancreatin (Thermo Scientific Chemicals) for 15 min at 4 °C. Embryos were washed with collection medium (described earlier) and mesoderm tissue was dissected using insect pins (Roboz) attached to syringes. Explants were transferred to fibronectin-coated 18-well µ slides (Ibidi) plates and left to adhere for 3–4 h in medium containing a 1:4 ratio of rat serum to embryo culture medium (described earlier), prior to downstream experiments and/or chemical inhibitor treatments. For live imaging of migration dynamics, explants were imaged every 5 min up to 3 h. For immunofluorescence staining, explants were cultured up to 17 h and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min. For RNA sequencing, explants were cultured to 27 h then scraped off with sterile insect pins and flash-frozen.

*** Mouse embryos were collected at early streak, mid streak and late streak stages of gastrulation and cultured with 1 mM 2-NBDG60(Cayman Chemicals) for 2 h. For multiphoton microscopy, embryos were immediately live-imaged. For confocal microscopy, embryos were fixed in PBS containing 4% PFA for 15 min then immediately imaged after a 5 min wash in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20).

*** Cells underwent mesoderm-directed differentiation on 8-well µ slides (Ibidi) as previously described. On day 2.5 when cells are at the EpiSC stage, cells were cultured with differentiation medium that included 50 µg ml−1DQ gelatin (Invitrogen), then were fixed on day 3.5 in PBS containing 4% PFA for 20 min, protected from light. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer (described below) with DAPI (overnight at 4 °C or 20 min room temperature) prior to imaging.

*** 18-well µ slides (Ibidi) were prepared with FITC–Fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% gelatin following the manufacturer’s 2-day protocol and protected from light. Explants were cultured on these plates for 16 h prior to fixation in PBS containing 4% PFA for 20 min. Explants were incubated in blocking buffer (described below) with DAPI (overnight at 4 °C or 20 min room temperature) prior to imaging.

*** Mouse gastrulas were collected at ES stage and cultured with either 200 nM MitoTracker Deep Red or 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM). Embryos were cultured in the respective dyes for 30 min and then imaged in a humidified chamber with 37 °C and 5% CO2according to the same parameters described below for live imaging.

*** Samples were fixed in PBS containing 4% PFA for 20-45 min room temperature, or in methanol for 20 min at 4 °C where stated. After fixation, samples were washed twice with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and permeabilized in PBS with 1 mM glycine and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 20–60 min at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations took place overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% Tween-20). Samples were washed twice with PBS-T prior to secondary antibody incubations at 4 °C in blocking buffer. On the final day, samples were washed twice with PBS-T, then transferred into PBS-A droplets (PBS with 0.75% Bovine Albumin Fraction V (Gibco)) and covered with mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) in 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) before confocal imaging. All PBS-T washes were done for 10 min room temperature, and all room temperature incubations or washes took place on a rocking platform. All antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table1.

*** Samples were imaged with the Leica STELLARIS 5 microscope using a HC PL APO CS2 40×/1.10 or a HC FLUOTAR L 25×/0.95 W VISIR 0.17 water objectives, az-spacing of 0.75 µm to 5 µm and appropriate laser and filters for Alexa 405, Alexa 488, Alexa 546 and Alexa 633 or combinations thereof. To correct for fluorescence decay along thezaxis during embryo imaging, ‘z-compensation by AOTF and PMT’ was defined in a control embryo and applied across all experimental conditions during that imaging session, so that changes in laser power and gain across thez-stack were equivalent across conditions, and only adjusted to each embryo’s size. Raw data were processed using open-source image analysis software Fiji/ImageJ2 2.9.0 or AIVIA 10.5.1 AI Image Analysis Software and assembled in Photoshop 2021 22.3.1 (Adobe) or Illustrator 2024 28.6 (Adobe). Transverse views were generated from 1 µmz-spaced images using ImageJ’s orthogonal viewer. Digital quantifications and immunofluorescence signal intensity graphs were obtained using plot profile measurements in Image J and visualized in GraphPad Prism10.2.3. software.

*** Confocal time-lapse imaging of embryos, mesoderm explants, and mesoderm-differentiated cell cultures were performed using Leica STELLARIS 5 microscope using a 25× (HC FLUOTAR L 25×/0.95 W VISIR 0.17) or 40× (HC PL APO CS2 40×/1.10) water objective and appropriate laser/filters for Alexa 488, Alexa 546 and Alexa 633 or combinations thereof. Samples were imaged under a humidified chamber with 37 °C and 5% CO2. Explants were imaged at 5 min intervals in 2 µmz-spaced planes for up to 4 h on pre-treated ibidi dishes (Ibidi). Images were processed using AIVIA, described below under ‘Image analysis’.

*** Multicolour two-photon microscopy was used for live-embryo imaging of NAD(P)H dynamics. Embryos kept in ex vivo culture medium (described earlier) with the addition of 20 mM HEPES. Images were acquired with LA Vision TriM Scope II (LaVision Biotec) laser scanning microscope equipped with a Chameleon Vision II and Discovery ultrafast lasers (Coherent) for different wavelengths imaged sequentially after eachz-section15. Wavelengths of 750 nm were used for NAD(P)H and 940 nm for H2B-GFP:Tcf-LEF or ERK-KTRmCloverreporter. Although excitation ranges of NAD(P)H and GFP overlapped, their emission was separated by band pass filters: blue range (425–475 nm; NAD(P)H) and green range (500–550 nm; FAD). Exclusion of nuclear GFP signal (in H2B-GFP:Tcf-LEF embryos) from NAD(P)H channel validated separation of emission signals of NAD(P)H and GFP. Embryos were imaged using a 40× water immersion lens (Nikon; NA 1.15) at 400 Hz with pixel size of 0.2 µm or 0.3 µm and az-step of 1 or 1.5 µm. For optimal signal-to-noise ratio, Line averaging of 2 was done for all NAD(P)H images. The fluorescence detected from the reduced metabolites through this method captures both NADH and NADPH (thus called NAD(P)H)61. It should be noted that the intracellular concentrations of the non-phosphorylated NADH and NAD+ is much higher than NAD(P)H and NADP+(ref.62). We further validated that NAD(P)H fluorescence signal in the embryos closely co-localized and followed 2-NBDG uptake.

*** All embryos were positioned exactly along the A–P axis (refer to figures) during imaging for easier quantifications.

*** Mid-embryo sagittal sections of embryos stained for GLUT1 and GLUT3 and with DAPI were used for glucose-uptake quantification in Fiji/ImageJ2. For each embryo, the angle vertex was allocated at the proximal-most boundary between epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm, at the mid-point between posterior-most (0°) and anterior-most (180°) epiblast. Two angle values were calculated for every embryo (‘GLUT start’ and ‘GLUT end’) to capture the range of observable GLUT expression in the epiblast, along with the primitive streak distal length of the embryo to allocate Theiler staging (ES, MS or LS, as described above). ‘GLUT start’ and ‘GLUT end’ means were calculated for each stage and visualized in a rose diagram with RStudio.

*** Mid-embryo sagittal sections of DAPI-stained embryos were used for primitive streak distal elongation quantification in Fiji/ImageJ2. For each embryo, the 0% cut-off was marked by anterior epiblast morphology, the 100% cut-off was assigned to the distal-most epiblast cell, and ‘PS’ (primitive streak) was marked at the distal-most point where the primitive streak morphology extends (Fig.2b). Measurements were obtained for the vertical distance between 0% and 100% and between 0% and ‘PS’, so that each embryo’s primitive streak elongation percentage (0-to-PS divided by 0-to-100) is adjusted to its size. Thus, a control embryo’s primitive streak distal elongation percentage of 95% (Fig.2b) can be interpreted as ‘this embryo has elongated its primitive streak to 95% of its epiblast height’. Theiler stages could be assigned with this measurement: ≤50 for ES; between 50 and 100 for MS; >100 for LS.

*** Mid-embryo sagittal sections of laminin and DAPI-stained embryos were used for basement membrane calculations in Fiji/ImageJ2. For each embryo, the 0% cut-off was marked by anterior epiblast morphology, the 100% cut-off was assigned to the distal-most epiblast cell, and ‘intact BM’ was marked at the distal-most point where laminin was still intact (Fig.2d). Measurements were obtained for the vertical distance between 0% and 100% and between 0% and ‘BM’, so that each embryo’s basement membrane breakdown percentage (0-to-BM divided by 0-to-100) is adjusted to its size. Thus, a control embryo’s basement membrane breakdown readout of 96% (Fig.2d) can be interpreted as ‘this embryo has broken down 96% of its vertical basement membrane length’.

*** z-sections of DAPI-stained mesoderm explants imaged with a 40× objective were used for fibronectin perforation calculations, with ≥3 images captured per explant. For every image, cell number and perforation number were calculated. Invadapodia degradation is represented as a percentage (perforation number divided by cell number).

*** Sagittal sections of ERK-KTR embryos were used to quantify ERK activity. Manual segmentations were drawn for each cell in Fiji/ImageJ2 to delineate nuclear and cytoplasmic areas, using ERK-KTR and brightfield channels to verify cell morphologies (Extended Data Fig.8b). For every cell, the following measurements were quantified: nuclear areana, cytoplasmic areaca(including the nucleus), nuclear ERK-KTR intensityni, and nuclear-subtracted cytoplasmic ERK-KTR intensityci. To calculate the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, the average nuclear intensity (ni/na) was divided by the average cytoplasmic intensity (ci/(ca−na)), such that a ratio ≥1 indicates no ERK activity.

*** Live-imaged videos captured with a 40× objective were used for proliferation counts of TCF-LEF reporter mesoderm explants, quantified manually in Fiji/ImageJ2. For each explant, an overall cell count for ‘starting population’ was calculated on the first frame, and a ‘cell division’ event (TCF-LEF telophase observation) was also assigned by careful frame-to-frame assessment over the course of the video. A proliferation index (cell division number/starting population) was then obtained for each explant, such that a highest index of 1 can be interpreted as ‘every cell at the beginning of the video has divided by the end of the video’. This was then adjusted to the total frame length of the video so that explants across different experimental replicates and video lengths could be compared. Thus, a control explant with a readout of 16.5% (Fig.4b) can be interpreted as ‘16.5% of the mesoderm cells at the beginning of the video have divided by the end of the video’.

*** AIVIA 10.5.1 AI image analysis software was used to examine mesoderm explant migration dynamics. Nuclear segmentations were generated using a ‘cell-tracking’ recipe, applying a pixel classifier that was trained on TCF-LEF nuclear fluorescent channels from videos of each treatment group in every experimental replicate (Fig.4b). Parameter values were modified between rounds of pixel classifier ‘previewing’ and training to ensure nuclear segmentation accuracy. Every track was manually examined against the brightfield channel to verify detection accuracy. Incorrect lineages were corrected in the ‘track editor’ or discarded from the final dataset, and parent and daughter tracks were treated independently. Every track measurement of interest was exported to Excel and normalized to its detection length (‘first frame’ subtracted from ‘last frame’) so that lineages of different detection lengths could be compared. Thus, all data points are plotted in µm min−1or µm s−1.

*** Imaris 10.0.1 software was used to count T-positive, total, and pyknotic cells. Nuclear segmentations were generated using the ‘Surfaces’ function. Parameters such as background subtraction and morphological splitting were adjusted using the Creation Wizard tool to identify the optimal algorithm settings. Pyknotic cells were counted in the DAPI channel using an increased threshold for background subtraction and a smaller diameter for segmentation than when counting healthy cells using the DAPI signal. Surfaces were examined relative to the original staining throughout creation and in their final state to ensure accuracy.

*** Protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific 89900). The reagents were supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 87786) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor (Phos Stop Roche 4906845001) to prevent protein degradation and dephosphorylation during extraction. The protein concentrations were quantified using Pierce BCA. protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, 23225) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein was denatured at 95–100 °C for 5 min in 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher, NP0007) containing 10% v/v β-mercaptoethanol (Millipore Sigma, M6250). The protein electrophoresis was performed using 4–20% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, 4568095) in 1× Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (diluted from Bio-Rad, 1610732) at 110 V for 1 h for all proteins. The proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane (ThermoFisher, IB301032) by wet transfer for 1 h at 100 V using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot Cell following the manufacturer’s instructions. Wet transfer buffer was 20% methanol, 200 mM glycine, and 250 mM Tris. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Primary antibodies were incubated with the membrane at recommended concentrations at either 1 h room temperature or 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed three times in TBST for 5 min each, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted at 1:5,000 ratio in 5% non-fat milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times in TBST for 5 min each. Blots were treated with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher, 34094) for 2–5 min at room temperature. The blots were imaged using a CCD camera-based imager ProteinSimple FluorChem E system.

*** Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy Micro Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). The amounts of mRNA were measured using the PowerUp SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative levels of transcript expression were assessed by the ΔΔCtmethod, withGapdhas an endogenous control. For primers used in qPCR with reverse transcription, see Supplementary Table2.

*** Total RNA was extracted from mesoderm explants using a PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). RNA samples were submitted to the Yale Center for Genome Analysis for quality assessment, library preparation and sequencing. Each RNA sample contained explants from 2 embryos, and 2 samples were submitted per condition. Paired-end reads were aligned using Star (v2.7.9a) to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using the Ensembl transcriptome (release 109)63. Analysis of differential gene expression was performed using DESeq2 (v1.40.1). To identify differentially regulated genes between samples for downstream analyses, we selected genes with log2-transformed fold change greater than 0.7 or less than −0.7 and an adjustedPvalue < 0.01. Gene ontology analysis was performed using topGO (v2.52.0) using the ‘weight01’ algorithm for Fisher’s exact tests on R studio (version 2023.12.1 + 402). KEGG pathway analysis was performed using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp)64,65.

*** Previously published single-cell RNA sequencing data from gastrulating mouse embryos were accessed using MouseGastrulationData (v1.12.0) (https://github.com/MarioniLab/MouseGastrulationData). Data were subset to include only ‘epiblast’, ‘primitive streak’ and ‘nascent mesoderm’ cell states from all samples staged E6.5 to E8.5 (samples 1–10, 12– 20 and 23– 37; samples 11, 21 and 22 were omitted from our analysis because their staging was ambiguous, for example, a sample labelled as ‘mixed gastrulation’). Counts were log-normalized using Seurat (v. 4.3.0)66,67,68,69,70. Cells were first randomly down-sampled for visualization purposes to 400 cells per cell type. Pseudotime and trajectory interference analyses were performed using Slingshot (v2.8.0)71for principle curve calculation; SingleCellExperiment (v1.22.0)72and scater (v.1.28.0)73were used for visualization of gene expression over pseudotime. The principle curve was then traced over the first two principal components to infer pseudo-temporal organization.

*** Statistical tests were performed on GraphPad Prism 10.2.3 software. For comparison of two groups, two-sided unpairedt-tests were applied. For comparisons of three or more groups, one-way ANOVAs were used, followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests for comparisons to control or Tukey’s multiple comparison tests for comparisons between all groups, unless otherwise stated.Pvalues are displayed on figure panels or in legends. All the experiments were performed at least in three biological replicates unless specifically described in the methods and the figure legends. Figure legends indicate the number of embryos, cells, explants or stem cell structures and, when relevant, the number of experiments performed for each analysis. Statistical power calculations were not used to determine sample size.
