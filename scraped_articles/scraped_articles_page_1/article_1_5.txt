*** Many organisms, including cosmopolitan drosophilids, show circadian plasticity, varying their activity with changing dawn–dusk intervals1. How this behaviour evolves is unclear. Here we compareDrosophila melanogasterwithDrosophila sechellia, an equatorial, ecological specialist that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the mechanistic basis of circadian plasticity evolution2.D. sechelliahas lost the ability to delay its evening activity peak time under long photoperiods. Screening of circadian mutants inD. melanogaster/D. sechelliahybrids identifies a contribution of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) to this loss.Pdfexhibits species-specific temporal expression, due in part tocis-regulatory divergence. RNA interference and rescue experiments inD. melanogasterusing species-specificPdfregulatory sequences demonstrate that modulation of this neuropeptide’s expression affects the degree of behavioural plasticity. ThePdfregulatory region exhibits signals of selection inD. sechelliaand across populations ofD. melanogasterfrom different latitudes. We provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage forD. melanogasterat elevated latitude, whereasD. sechelliaprobably suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot locus for circadian plasticity evolution that might have contributed to bothD. melanogaster’s global distribution andD. sechellia’s specialization.

*** Nervous systems coordinate animals’ behavioural responses to the external world. This task becomes challenging when environments are variable, particularly for broadly distributed species. One way to face changing conditions is with behavioural plasticity—that is, the ability to adjust behavioural phenotypes to match environmental fluctuations. Many examples of plastic behaviours exist: songbirds shift their vocalization frequencies in response to anthropogenic noise3, and lizards change their basking behaviour according to altitude4. How behavioural plasticity is determined and evolves is unknown.

*** A common example of plastic behaviour is circadian activity, whereby species adjust their activity patterns in response to seasonal variation in day length5. This ability is critical, because circadian activity coordinates specific behaviours with optimal activity throughout the day to maximize food availability and synchronize social behaviours6. Deviations from regular circadian patterns can negatively affect fitness and species persistence7. Drosophilids are a powerful system with which to study circadian behavioural plasticity. These flies show bouts of activity surrounding dawn and dusk (morning and evening activity peaks), separated by a period of relative inactivity8. The best-studied species, the cosmopolitanDrosophila melanogaster, plasticly adjusts its circadian rhythm depending on seasonal variation in photoperiod1. Notably, the degree of photoperiod plasticity of different strains of this species correlates with their latitude of origin9. Moreover, several distantly related, high-latitude species have evolved divergent patterns of activity and extreme plasticity, allowing their daily activity to match long summer days10.

*** An interesting comparison species toD. melanogasteris the closely relatedDrosophila sechellia2(Fig.1a), which is endemic to the equatorial Seychelles islands, where it experiences little seasonal photoperiod variation (Fig.1a,b). Here we describe marked differences in the circadian activity and plasticity ofD. sechelliaandD. melanogaster, and investigate the mechanistic basis of these differences.

*** Source Data

*** We first measured the circadian behaviour ofD. melanogasterandD. sechelliaunder a 12:12 h light:dark cycle (12:12 h LD) and four extended photoperiods, ranging from mild (14:10 h LD) to extreme (20:4 h LD) (Fig.1c). We used males of two strains each ofD. melanogasterandD. sechellia(Supplementary Table1), to distinguish inter- from intraspecific differences. TheD. melanogasterstrains (DmelCS andDmelOR) were collected at around 41° N and 44° N, respectively; theD. sechelliastrains (Dsec07 andDsec28) were from the Seychelles, around 4° S (Fig.1a). TheD. melanogasterandD. sechelliastrains thus initially evolved in environments with annual photoperiod variation on the scale of several hours or minutes, respectively (Fig.1b). Under each photoperiod, all strains showed activity peaks during the morning and evening, although the timing of peak evening activity varied by photoperiod (Fig.1c). We quantified the average evening peak time of the last 4 of 7 days in a given photoperiod (Methodsand Fig.1c). ForD. melanogaster, the timing of the evening activity peak was commensurately delayed as photoperiod increased (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.1a). By contrast, forD. sechelliawe observed notably little evening peak plasticity, with a median delay in evening peak time of maximum around 1 h regardless of photoperiod (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.1a). Importantly, we detected a significant interaction between photoperiod and species (Extended Data Fig.1a). Under the most extreme photoperiod, manyD. sechelliashowed arrhythmicity (Fig.1c) and decreased activity (Extended Data Fig.1b), contributing to the increased variability in evening peak time. The absence of evening peak plasticity was also apparent in femaleD. sechellia(Extended Data Fig.1c).

*** D. sechelliais much less active during the dark phase thanD. melanogaster(Fig.1c). Quantification of predawn activity (3 h preceding lights-on) under 12:12 h LD showed thatD. sechelliawas generally inactive during this period, whereasD. melanogastershowed ample, albeit strain-specific, activity (Fig.1d), a difference also seen in females (Extended Data Fig.1d). We next measured free-running activity by acclimating our strains to 12:12 h LD before submitting them to constant dark conditions (DD). BothD. melanogasterandD. sechelliaremained rhythmic under DD (Fig.1e) showing a period of around 24 h (Extended Data Fig.1e,f). However, at the subjective dawn,D. melanogastershowed clear activity peaks, whereasD. sechelliaexhibited very little activity, even during the first day of DD (Fig.1e). Low predawn activity therefore reflects a reduced morning activity peak ofD. sechellia, and the activity observed after lights-on under 12:12 h LD is probably largely a startle response. Consistently, when we quantified morning peak timing under 12:12 h LD,D. melanogasterreached peak activity before lights-on, as previously described11, whereasD. sechelliapeaked only at, or just after, lights-on (Fig.1f).

*** We extended our analyses to two otherD. melanogasterstrains12(collected near their ancestral range13(roughly 16° S)), two additionalD. sechelliastrains, as well as closer relatives ofD. sechellia(Fig.1a):Drosophila simulans12(collected from its ancestral range14, around 19° S) andDrosophila mauritiana(endemic to Mauritius, roughly 20° S) (Extended Data Fig.2a,d). Under 16:8 h LD conditions, allD. melanogaster,D. simulansandD. mauritianastrains exhibited a higher degree of evening peak plasticity compared withD. sechellia(Extended Data Fig.2b). The degree of evening peak plasticity reflected a latitudinal effect: tropicalD. melanogasterstrains showed reduced plasticity when compared with high-latitude strains (Extended Data Fig.2b). The majority of non-D. sechelliastrains also exhibited substantial morning activity (Extended Data Fig.2c). These results indicate that the lack of plasticity and reduction in morning activity observed inD. sechelliaprobably represent losses in this lineage.

*** To identify the genetic basis of species differences, we took a candidate approach. InD. melanogaster, 150 circadian neurons contain a molecular feedback loop that tracks a period of approximately 24 h (refs.15,16) and controls the rhythmic expression of effectors, representing many candidates (Fig.2a). BecauseD. sechelliatraits reflect evolutionary losses, we reasoned that causalD. sechelliaalleles were probably recessive toD. melanogasterand thus designed a screen inD. melanogaster/D. sechelliahybrids (Fig.2b). We generated hemizygous test hybrids containingD. melanogastermutations for individual candidates to show any recessive phenotype of theD. sechelliaallele at the same locus. We also generated heterozygous control hybrids, using either theD. melanogaster w1118strain (a common genetic background of mutants) or CSW(pigment-dispersing factor(Pdf);Methods) and eachD. sechelliastrain. Differences between control and test hybrids are probably due to loss of theD. melanogasterallele in the test hybrid. Gene dosage effects were assessed by testing controlD. melanogasterhemizygotes. Genes whose mutations showed a consistent effect in both test hybrid backgrounds compared with control hybrids, but not in hemizygousD. melanogaster, were considered the strongest candidates to explain interspecific differences (Fig.2c).

*** To assess candidates for an effect on evening peak plasticity, we observed test and control hybrids under 16:8 h LD. Control hybrids of either thew1118(Extended Data Fig.3a–d) or CSWbackground (Fig.2d,eand Extended Data Fig.4) showed a higher degree of evening peak plasticity than theirD. sechelliaparental strain, confirming that theD. melanogastergenotype underlying plasticity is partially dominant to that ofD. sechellia, although the degree of plasticity is strain dependent. We screened 14 genes representing the majority of the circadian feedback loop, and many of its modulators and effectors. Mutations in only one reduced evening peak plasticity in both test hybrid backgrounds but not in hemizygousD. melanogaster:Pdf(Fig.2d,eand Extended Data Fig.3e–g). This is a promising gene in regard to explaining species differences because, inD. melanogaster, Pdf is essential for delaying the phase of the endogenous clock in circadian neurons under long photoperiods17,18,19.

*** We also screened these genotypes under 12:12 h LD and quantified predawn activity as a measure of morning activity (Extended Data Fig.5a–d).w1118control hybrids showed intermediate morning activity relative to parental strains. Consistently, four genes showed an effect in test hybrids of both backgrounds (Fig.2f,g) but not in hemizygousD. melanogaster(Extended Data Fig.5e–g). These encode the transcriptional feedback loop proteins CYC and CRY (responsible for light-dependent synchronization of the molecular clock20), and Hr38 and VRI, which are neural activity-dependent transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators ofPdf, respectively21,22(Fig.2h).

*** We focused onPdf, because of its unique effect on evening peak plasticity and evidence thattrans-regulation ofPdfexpression influences morning peak activity. ThePdfcoding sequence is almost perfectly conserved across species (Extended Data Fig.6), indicating that behavioural divergence must be due to species-specific differences inPdfexpression. InD. melanogaster, Pdf is expressed in eight neurons in each brain hemisphere: four large and four small ventrolateral clock neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs, respectively) (Fig.3a). s-LNvs control the timing of morning activity, whereas l-LNvs can delay the phase of the evening activity peak under long photoperiods23,24,25,26, although a functional clock is required in both for photoperiod plasticity24,27. The spatial distribution of this neuropeptide is conserved inD. sechellia(Fig.3a), consistent with analysis across diverse drosophilids28, suggesting that species-specific differences exist in the temporal pattern and/or levels of Pdf expression.

*** Using quantitative single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), we comparedPdftranscript levels betweenD. melanogasterandD. sechellia, focusing primarily on s-LNvs, in which Pdf expression shows a clear temporal pattern that more probably correlates with secretion of this neuropeptide29. Under 12:12 h LD,DmelCS expressed overall morePdfRNA thanDsec07 throughout the morning activity peak, particularly predawn, withDsec07 reaching near-similar levels only after lights-on (Fig.3b). Immunofluorescence quantification of Pdf peptide levels in the axonal projections of s-LNvs for the same time points spanning the morning activity peak (Fig.3c) showed a consistently high level of Pdf inD. melanogaster, including in the hours preceding lights-on. By contrast, inD. sechellia, Pdf signal was lower in the predawn period and increased to an equivalent amount toD. melanogasteronly by lights-on. This pattern corresponds well to that of the relative levels ofPdftranscripts, and to species differences in morning peak activity at these times (Fig.1c,d). We also analysed Pdf immunofluorescence in the s-LNv soma. Consistent with previous observations29, Pdf signal remained high across the morning peak times in the s-LNv soma ofD. melanogaster(Fig.3d). InD. sechellia, the Pdf signal began high but dropped significantly only after lights-on. These observations suggest thatD. sechelliahas a weaker and/or shorter pulse ofPdfexpression in s-LNvs around the morning peak compared withD. melanogaster, such that once this neuropeptide accumulates to high levels in the axon termini at or after lights-on (Fig.3c), it becomes depleted from the soma (Fig.3d).

*** Pdf expression in the l-LNvs ofD. melanogasterhas been described as high and constant29. Consistently, using smFISH under both 12:12 and 16:8 h LD, we observed relatively stable expression across time points (Extended Data Fig.7a,b). However, we noted aD. melanogaster-specific drop in transcript abundance under 12:12 h LD following lights-off that was not apparent under 16:8 h LD, when the lights remained on at the same time point. Pdf immunofluorescence intensity in the l-LNv soma was not significantly different between these species under both photoperiods, but showed substantial variability, particularly forD. sechelliaunder 16:8 h LD (Extended Data Fig.7c,d). It remains unclear whether and how Pdf secretion rate in the l-LNv axon termini differs between these species under distinct photoperiods.

*** InD. melanogaster, the axonal projections of s-LNvs to the dorsal circadian neurons (Fig.3a) show circadian structural plasticity, reaching peak branching complexity during the day30. This phenomenon depends, in part, on cyclic expression and release of Pdf from both s-LNvs and l-LNvs and expression of the Pdf receptor31. To test whether the species-specific temporal patterns of Pdf expression are accompanied by differences in neuronal remodelling, we quantified the branching complexity of s-LNv projections during both light (2 h) and dark (14 h) phases under 12:12 h LD (Fig.3e). During the light phase, we found statistically indistinguishable levels of complexity in the two species and observed in both a decrease in complexity from the light to the dark phase. However, branching complexity in the dark phase was significantly lower inD. melanogasterthan inD. sechellia(Fig.3e). This apparent lower structural plasticity ofD. sechelliaPdf neurons corroborates the reduced dynamic changes in Pdf expression in this species.

*** Because our hybrid screen identified an effect of thePdflocus (and not atrans-regulator) on evening peak delay, we hypothesized that expression differences result from divergence in this gene’scis-regulatory region. We cloned around 2.4 kb genomic DNA 5’ ofPdffromD. melanogaster(similar to the sequence used in ref.29) andD. sechelliaupstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. These constructs were integrated in an identical location inD. melanogaster, facilitating comparison of their activity in a common genomic andtransenvironment. Both species’Pdfreporters exclusively labelled the l-LNvs and s-LNvs (Fig.3f). We first measured reporter expression in l-LNvs, focusing on behaviourally relevant time points under 12:12 and 16:8 h LD (Fig.3g,h). In l-LNvs, throughout the evening activity peak under both photoperiods, theD. sechellia5’-regulatory region consistently drove lower and more constant reporter expression relative to theD. melanogastersequence (Fig.3g,h). Notably, theD. melanogaster Pdfreporter showed a sudden drop in expression at either 8 h (under 12:12 h LD) or 12 h (under 16:8 h LD), before returning to a higher level; this expression pattern potentially reflects a new pulse in transcriptional activity that is photoperiod sensitive.

*** InD. melanogaster, s-LNvs are essential for resetting the phase of the circadian clock32,33and morning peak activity23,25. We therefore compared reporter expression in s-LNv axonal projections—in which the highest cyclic Pdf expression was observed over a 24 h period29—for time points spanning the morning activity peak (Fig.3i). TheD. sechellia5’-regulatory sequence drives lower expression of the reporter but, in contrast to reporter expression in l-LNvs during the evening peak, with a similar temporal pattern.

*** These results indicate divergence of thePdf5’-regulatory region betweenD. sechelliaandD. melanogaster, most probably affecting transcriptional activity. However, because the region encompasses thePdf5’-untranslated region, we cannot exclude the possibility that it influences transcript stability or translation34.

*** We next asked whether species-specificcis-regulatory activity ofPdfis sufficient to influence behaviour. We initially used theD. melanogasterandD. sechellia Pdf5’-regulatory regions to generate Pdf neuron drivers to induce ‘strong’ (D. melanogaster Pdf-Gal4) or ‘weak’ (D. sechellia Pdf-Gal4) RNA interference (RNAi) ofPdf31, validating the distinct efficacy of knockdown with smFISH (Extended Data Fig.8). Under both 12:12 and 16:8 h LD,DmelPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiflies showed a marked advance in evening peak time relative to controls (Fig.4a–c). Under 12:12 h LD, there was no difference in the degree of evening peak advance between knockdown treatments. By contrast, under 16:8 h LD,DsecPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiflies showed a smaller, non-significant, decrease in evening peak time relative to control animals, with a notable increase in variance (Fig.4a–c). Importantly, under 16:8 h LD, the difference between thePdfRNAigenotypes—of otherwise identical genetic background—was significant. These results indicate that the level (and possibly temporal dynamics) ofPdfexpression is sufficient to affect evening peak plasticity. We also quantified the predawn activity (Fig.4d) of these flies under 12:12 h LD. BothDmelPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiandDsecPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiflies exhibited reduced predawn activity relative to controls. However,DmelPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiandDsecPdf-Gal4>PdfRNAiflies did not show significant differences in predawn activity following post hoc correction for multiple comparisons.

*** To test explicitly whether divergence ofPdf cis-regulatory regions is sufficient to explain species’ behavioural differences, we rescued Pdf expression in aPdf-nullD. melanogasterbackground with transgenes containing either theD. melanogasterorD. sechellia Pdf5’-regulatory region fused to theD. melanogaster Pdfcoding sequence. Under 12:12 h LD, rescue strains showed typical patterns of activity, with evening peaks centred around lights-off, whereasPdfmutants showed a significantly advanced evening peak time (Fig.4e,f). Under 16:8 h LD, rescue strains showed greater evening peak plasticity thanPdfmutants (Fig.4g). Importantly, those containing theD. melanogaster Pdf5’-regulatory region showed slightly, but significantly, greater evening peak delay than those with theD. sechellia5’-regulatory sequence (Fig.4g). We also recorded substantial predawn activity inD. melanogaster5’-regulatory rescue strains compared withPdfmutants under 12:12 h LD (Fig.4h), but observed a lower increase in those expressingPdfunder theD. sechellia5’-regulatory region (Fig.4h). Importantly, there is again a significant difference between species-specific rescue strains. Together, these results support a contribution ofPdf cis-regulatory divergence to species differences in both evening peak plasticity and morning activity.

*** To determine whether thePdf5’-regulatory sequence exhibits evolutionary signatures, we constructed a maximum-likelihood phylogeny of sequences of this region fromD. melanogaster,D. sechellia,D. simulansandD. mauritianastrains, rooted with sequences from more distant drosophilids (Fig.5a). Unlike the species tree,D. sechellia Pdf5’-regulatory sequences formed a monophyletic group, whereas the cosmopolitanD. melanogasterandD. simulanssequences clustered, representing the most derived sequences.D. mauritianaand MadagascanD. simulansstrains showed closer similarity toD. sechelliasequences than cosmopolitanD. melanogasterandD. simulans, potentially reflecting inter- and intraspecific variation between populations at different latitudes. Motif enrichment analysis35identified putative regulatory sequences in these species’ 5’ regions. Although all motifs were shared amongD. melanogasterandD. simulanssequences, four were degenerated or absent inD. sechelliaand one site was unique to this species (Fig.5b), potentially affecting its activity through the loss (or gain) of transcription factor-binding sites.

*** We next investigated whether sequence divergence between theD. melanogasterandD. sechellia5’-regulatory sequences results from natural selection. We first determined whether variants within theD. melanogaster Pdf5’-regulatory region are associated with higher degrees of evening peak plasticity observed with increasing latitudes9. Using single-nucleotide variant frequencies in the genomes of globally distributedD. melanogasterpopulations36, we chose 13 populations representing a wide range of latitudes (Fig.5c). We correlated minor allele frequency (MAF) across all variable sites detected within thePdf5’-regulatory sequence with the estimated latitude of the population collection site. Because correlations could reflect the underlying population structure as a result ofD. melanogaster’s demographic history during emigration from its native African range37, as controls we repeated this analysis for a 2.4 kb 5’ region of two other neuropeptide genes,sNPFandAstC. A positive correlation was consistently observed between population latitude and MAF for each variable site within thePdf5’-regulatory region, but not for controls (Fig.5c). These comparisons indicate that the effect of latitude on MAF ofPdf5’-regulatory variants is different from that expected due to demography alone, suggesting a role for selection on these sites inD. melanogaster, similar to clinal variation in other circadian genes38,39,40,41. Among laboratoryD. melanogasterstrains, these single-nucleotide variants occur with an approximate MAF of 25%, but none were present inD. sechelliastrains (Fig.5d), consistent with a potential function of these variants in increasing evening peak plasticity.

*** To test for signs of selection within theD. sechelliapopulation, we used 82Pdf5’-regulatory sequences (plussNPFandAstCcontrol sequences) from individuals recently sampled from the Seychelles42to calculate Tajima’sD-and Fu and Li’sD*- andF*-statistics40. All three statistics were significantly negative forPdf, but not for control genes, consistent with recent directional selection acting on this circadian gene (Fig.5e). Thus, selection might also act to reduce aspects of circadian plasticity at the equator.

*** To identify a potential mechanism by which natural selection acts, we asked whether plasticity in circadian activity impacts fitness. We first examined lifespan, which is impacted by photoperiod in other animals43and probably affects lifetime reproductive output. BothD. melanogasterandD. sechelliamaintained under 16:8 h LD showed a significant reduction in lifespan relative to those under 12:12 h LD (Fig.5fand Extended Data Fig.9a,b). However, the detrimental effect of longer photoperiod was not observed until several weeks had elapsed, by which time flies could certainly reproduce, making it less likely to impact fitness in nature.

*** Circadian rhythms are important for synchronization of sexual behaviour among conspecifics6,44. We therefore reasoned that if evening peak plasticity (or the lack thereof) influences copulation success, it might affect fitness. We acclimated male and female virgins to 12:12 and 16:8 h LD for 4 days and observed copulation rates among pairs over a 2 h period after lights-on (Fig.5g). ForD. melanogaster, we observed no difference in copulation rates between treatments (Fig.5g). By contrast, for allD. sechelliastrains, there was a consistent reduction in copulation rate for flies acclimated to 16:8 h LD (Fig.5g, left). Pooling of strains by species showed a significant decrease in overall copulation byD. sechelliaacclimated to 16:8 h LD, but not byD. melanogaster(Fig.5g, right). For some strains, this reduction persisted for several days (Extended Data Fig.9c). These results demonstrate thatD. sechellia’s reproductive success—and thus, probably its fitness—is influenced by its lack of evening peak plasticity when exposed to extended photoperiods that it would never experience in nature. By contrast,D. melanogaster’s behavioural plasticity could allow it to circumvent these negative effects.

*** Identifying the mechanisms of behavioural plasticity is key to understanding how organisms have evolved to inhabit variable environments and to predict how they will persist in increasingly unstable ones45. We have characterized a circadian plasticity difference in drosophilids, providing a rare example of linking changes in gene function, central neuron populations and behavioural divergence.

*** InD. melanogaster, Pdf is required in the l-LNvs for photoperiod plasticity19, and interspecific spatial differences in Pdf expression exist28, notably in high-latitude species in which Pdf is restricted to the l-LNvs10,46. These observations, combined with our analyses, point to thePdflocus as a hotspot of evolution. Given Pdf’s terminal placement as an effector gene of the clock network21, its role in broad synchronization of circadian clock neurons47and its strong influence on circadian behaviours, changes in thecis-regulation ofPdfexpression might represent a minimally pleiotropic means of introducing plasticity into the clock neuronal network.

*** A single locus clearly does not explain the entirety of species differences in plasticity, as is true of most behaviours48. There are almost certainly contributions of additional genes that we have not tested and/or more complex genetic interactions that we cannot identify with our screen design. Beyond thecis-regulatory differences inPdfcharacterized here, the translation21, transport and secretion of this neuropeptide49are all potentially subject to divergent regulation.

*** D. sechelliaalso shows greatly reduced morning activity compared with other drosophilids. This phenotype is similar to that observed inD. melanogaster Pdfmutants50, and species-specificPdfrescue inD. melanogasterindicates a contribution ofcis-regulatory divergence of the locus. That our candidate screen did not find an effect of thePdflocus itself in this difference might reflect coevolution of thePdf5’-regulatory region and itstrans-acting factors, which could be masked in a hybrid genetic background. Indeed, our screen identified several genes with the ability to regulatePdfexpression intrans, highlighting a different evolutionary trajectory to evening peak plasticity divergence that nevertheless converges on this neuropeptide. The morning and evening oscillators partially overlap in function, sharing synaptic feedback19,51, with both being required for long-photoperiod adaptation27. Potential mechanistic and evolutionary connections between evening peak plasticity and morning activity require further exploration. Moreover, the evolutionary consequences, if any, of reduced morning peak activity inD. sechelliaremain unclear. These issues might be illuminated by analyses of the circadian pattern of other behaviours of this species (and its sympatric sister species), such as courtship or feeding, which could constitute further barriers to reproduction52.

*** Why hasD. sechellialost evening peak plasticity? One hypothesis is that, in a constant photoperiod, selection to maintain plasticity mechanisms is relaxed, leading these to degenerate over time. Alternatively, in stable environments, plasticity might come at a fitness cost, leading selection to favour its loss under constant photoperiods—for example, to enhance the robustness of circadian activity. Regardless, our view ofD. sechellia’s specialization should expand beyond evolution of host fruit preference to restriction to an equatorial environment. Indeed,D. sechellia’s circadian phenotype might contribute to its endemism, despite the wider range ofM. citrifolia53. Exploration of the impact of differences in circadian plasticity mechanisms on latitudinal constraint of other species seems warranted.

*** All flies were reared on a wheat flour/yeast/fruit juice medium in non-overlapping 2 week cycles, and kept in 12:12 h LD at 25 °C. ForD. sechelliastrains, we added an additional mixture of instantDrosophilamedium (Formula 4-24 blue, Carolina bio-supply) mixed with noni juice (Raab Vitalfood).

*** For comparisons of the circadian behaviour ofD. melanogaster,D. sechellia,D. simulansandD. mauritiana, at least two wild-type strains of each species were used (DmelCS,DmelOR,DmelLZV L72,DmelLZV L76,Dsec07,Dsec28,DsimMD221,DsimMD242,Dmau90 andDmau91). To screen candidate genes for effects on circadian behaviour differences betweenD. melanogasterandD. sechellia, we usedD. melanogasterstrains containing loss-of-function mutations for genes previously associated with circadian behaviour phenotypes. A list of fly strains and their hybridization success (when applicable) is provided in Supplementary Table1. When strains were not available (vrille) or not hybridizable (Jetandtimeless), we usedD. melanogasterdeficiency strains containing engineered chromosomal deletions spanning the region of a candidate gene (in addition to many other loci)54. In the case oftimeless, a deficiency strain did not hybridize either. ThePdfstrain we used is thePdf01allele50in the Canton-S genetic background (provided by C. Förster, University of Würzburg), because we were unable to hybridize the originalPdf01strain. To confirm that the effect we observed (Extended Data Fig.3) was not due to a difference inD. melanogastergenetic background, we compared hybrids made with thisPdf01strain to the same parental Canton-S (denoted here asDmelCSW, where W represents Würzburg), which showed predawn activity and evening peak plasticity qualitatively similar to ourDmelCS strain (Extended Data Fig.4). To visualize the collection sites of these strains, we generated a world map using the R package ‘maps’.

*** We generatedD. melanogaster/D. sechelliahybrids as previously described55. In brief, hours-old virgin females were crossed to males that were collected as virgins and aged at high density (15–20 flies) for 5–7 days. To increase interactions between flies, we pushed a plug into the vial to leave a 2–3 cm space above the food surface. These crosses yielded only sterile, but viable, males. This method does not allow us to test sex-linked candidate genes, including the core transcriptional feedback loop memberperiod56and the Pdf receptor gene,Pdfr47.

*** For all activity measurements, we used 1–3-day-old males in theDrosophilaactivity monitor system57in small incubators that continuously regulate light and temperature conditions (TriTech Research, no. DT2-CIRC-TK). In brief, this system uses an infrared beam that bisects a glass tube (5 mm inner diameter, 65 mm length) in which the fly is housed, to record activity as the number of beam crosses per minute. Flies were transferred into tubes under light CO2anaesthesia with a 5% sucrose, 2% agar (w/v) solution at one end and capped with a cotton plug at the other. Each monitor recorded the activity of up to 32 flies simultaneously, and multiple monitors were placed in a single incubator. For each genotype, we tested flies in at least two technical replicates.

*** All flies were first exposed to 7 days of 12:12 h LD and then shifted to one of four extended photoperiod cycles for an additional 7 days—14:10, 16:8, 18:6 or 20:4 h LD—to allow us to measure 12:12 h LD-associated (that is, predawn activity) and extended photoperiod-associated behaviours (that is, evening peak plasticity) for each animal. For assessment of free-running period, flies were exposed to 7 days of DD following 7 days of 12:12 h LD. For each photoperiod regime, we took the average activity of the final 4 days of each 7 day period. The initial 3 days were considered an acclimation period. All subsequent analyses were performed in R using the Rethomics package58. For activity plots, maximum normalization was performed to standardize all plots to a range of 0–1.

*** To quantify predawn activity, average normalized activity was calculated for each fly in 30 min bins in the 3 h preceding dawn. To quantify morning and evening peak times, peak activity was identified from the average activity of each fly in 10 min bins during the last 4 days of both the 12:12 h LD and extended photoperiod using custom R scripts (available at github.com/mshahandeh/circ_plasticity). First, a rolling triangular mean was applied to smooth the data, which were then split into two 12 h sections, the first spanning the time around lights-on and the second spanning the time around lights-off (at least 3 h preceding and 3 h after for both). The global peak was identified within each dataset and recorded as the timing of the morning and evening peak, respectively.

*** For activity plots shown in the figures, average activity is plotted in 30 min bins, with yellow and grey bars at the bottom indicating timing of lights-on and -off, respectively. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. For evening peak time, vertical dashed lines indicate the average timing of the evening peak; for predawn activity, dashed boxes highlight the predawn period (3 h before lights-on). For quantifications of both evening peak time and predawn activity, standard box plots were used in which the bold middle line represents the median of the data, the box the interquartile range and the whiskers the remaining quartiles. Outliers are depicted with data points.

*** We used thePdfprobe library described previously59bound to the Cy5 fluorophore (LubioScience), essentially following a published protocol60. Brains were imaged using an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710 or 880) equipped with a ×40 or ×63 oil-immersion objective, and using fixed settings to maximize the comparability of images within experiments. Images were captured using Microsoft ZEN 2.3 SP1 software. Images were processed in Fiji and RNA spots were counted using the Fiji macro RS-FISH61. No signal was detected outside of the LNv cell bodies. RNA spot counts between strains within photoperiod treatments were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test followed by post hoc correction for multiple tests62. We did not compare between experiments because these flies were dissected, stained and imaged separately. smFISH was repeated for two time points during the morning and evening peaks under both 12:12 and 16:8 h LD to ensure replicability of the overall pattern of expression. We did not pool these data because they are from a separate staining/imaging.

*** For immunofluorescence of whole-mountDrosophilabrains, 1–2-day-old males were collected and acclimated to a specific photoperiod for four additional days. To standardize sampling times, we fixed these flies in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation before dissection. Brains were dissected and stained essentially as described63. Primary and secondary antibodies and concentrations used are provided in Supplementary Table2. Brains were imaged using an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710 or 880) equipped with a ×20 or ×40 objective, and using fixed settings to maximize the comparability of images. Images were captured using Microsoft ZEN 2.3 SP1 software. To quantify fluorescence, images were processed in Fiji by first creating a maximum-intensity projectionz-stack, which was thresholded to remove background signal64. Relative fluorescence was measured for each set of neurons by structure (that is, LNv soma or s-LNv dorsal axonal projections) as integrated density of pixel intensity, and the average of both hemispheres was recorded for each brain. We compared Pdf immunofluorescence between strains within photoperiod treatments using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test followed by post hoc correction for multiple tests62. We did not compare between experiments because these flies were dissected, stained and imaged separately. We repeated immunostainings for two time points during the morning and evening peaks under both 12:12 and 16:8 h LD, to ensure replicability of the overall pattern of expression. These data cannot be pooled, however, because they are from a separate staining/imaging and produce different fluorescence measurements (arbitrary units).

*** For comparison of the structural plasticity of s-LNv axonal projections betweenD. melanogasterandD. sechellia, we imaged the most dorsal projections during two time points in the light and dark phases (2 and 14 h, respectively) at ×40 with a ×2 digital zoom. We performed Scholl analysis on these images, counting the number of axonal crossings with concentric 10 µm arcs using the Neuroanatomy Fiji plugin65. The number of axonal crossings was averaged per hemisphere for each brain and compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We performed this experiment in two replicates and pooled replicates for analysis because fluorescence intensity was not measured.

*** Approximately 2.4 kb upstream of thePdfstart codon was PCR amplified fromD. melanogaster(DmelCS) orD. sechellia(Dsec28) gDNA and Gateway cloned into the pDONR221 vector, sequenced verified and subcloned into pHemmarG (Addgene, no. 31221) for CD4:tdGFP reporters, pBPGUw (Addgene, no. 17575) for Gal4 drivers or fused to theD. melanogaster(DmelCS)Pdfcoding sequence in pattB66with Gibson assembly, for species-specific rescue constructs. Constructs were injected and integrated into the attP2 landing site (chromosome 3)67in theD. melanogastergenome by BestGene Inc. Rescue constructs were recombined into thePdf01background and genotyped with PCR and Sanger sequencing. For elimination of genetic background effects, for each species-specific rescue construct we collected data for two independent insertions. Oligonucleotides used for cloning and sequence verification are listed in Supplementary Table3.

*** We PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced thePdfgene region using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table3. Sequences were assembled and aligned in SnapGene (www.snapgene.com) using MUSCLE v.3.8.1551 (ref.68) and visually inspected for alignment errors.Pdfcoding sequences were translated to an amino acid alignment and visualized using Jalview69(v.2.11.2). For 5'-regulatory sequences, we used the R package phangorn to generate maximum-likelihood trees70, with the modelTest function to identify the best-fitting substitution model and performing standard bootstrapping to obtain support values. The MEME program was used to discover putative regulatory motifs common acrossPdf5’-regulatory sequences withn> 5 sequences per species35. We restricted this analysis to the top ten most significant motifs identified.

*** For detection of genomic patterns of clinal adaptation inPdf5’ sequences, we used a dataset of single-nucleotide variants in globally distributedD. melanogasterpopulations36. We selected populations from this dataset with a read depth greater than five to ensure confidence in variant frequencies. For each population, we calculated MAF across all variable sites in this region, and for the same-sized region upstream of the start codon of two control neuropeptide genes. Spearman’s rho was used to correlate MAF with the latitude of the capital city in each country in which the populations were sampled (precise latitudes were not available). Correlation coefficients for all variable sites within each locus were compared using at-test.

*** We obtained 41D. sechelliagenomes sampled in the Seychelles archipelago from the Sequence Read Archive42, aligned them to theD. sechelliareference genome (ASM438219v2), phasing the data by chromosome (Samtools v.1.19.2), and created consensus sequences for the 82Pdf5’-regulatory haplotypes. The software DNA sequence polymorphism (v.6) was used to calculate neutrality test statistics, with significance determined by 1,000 coalescence simulations.

*** To test for photoperiod-dependent differences in lifespan, we acclimated 1-day-oldDmelCS,DmelOR,Dsec07 andDsec28 males to either 12:12 h LD or 16:8 h LD. We kept ten flies of each genotype individually in vials containing wheat flour/yeast/fruit juice medium, to which we added an additional mixture of instantDrosophilamedium (Formula 4-24 blue, Carolina bio-supply), mixed with noni juice forD. sechelliaor apple cider vinegar (Denner) forD. melanogaster. Flies were transferred to fresh vials every 3 days to prevent media from drying out. We recorded for each weekday the number of vials in which a fly died until all flies among one treatment per strain were dead. No significant differences were detected between strains within species (Fisher’s exact test, allP> 0.05), which were therefore pooled to represent the species for Fig.5f. We compared cumulative survival probability using the R package ‘survival’ (ref.71). We performed a second replicate of these experiments to verify the observed effects (Extended Data Fig.9).

*** To test for photoperiod-dependent differences in copulation rate, we first acclimated 1-day-old virginDmelCS,DmelOR,Dsec07 andDsec28 males and females to either 12:12 or 16:8 h LD for 4 days. We aspirated single females into 25-mm-diameter food vials containing wheat flour/yeast/fruit juice medium, returned them to their respective photoperiods and allowed them to recover for 24 h. The following day, 30 min after lights-on, we aspirated a single male of the same genotype into each tube and pushed the plug into the vial so that pairs had a 2 cm space above the food surface, forcing them to interact. We observed courtship for 2 h, recording successfully and unsuccessfully copulating pairs. We reasoned that a consistent reduction in copulation success over 2 h would be sufficient to affect fitness in the field, in which individual flies interact for only much shorter periods of time72,73. We observed no differences between strains within species (Fig.5g; Fisher’s exact test, allP= 1), so these data were pooled to represent the species for analysis (Fig.5g).

*** To determine whether these differences persisted over the long term, following acclimation to either 12:12 h LD or 16:8 h LD for 4 days, single male–virgin female pairs were aspirated into the same food vials and stored at 25 °C for 3 days, after which the males were removed. Vials that produced offspring were counted as successful copulation. Copulation frequencies within species between treatments were compared using Fisher’s exact test.

*** No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. For behavioural experiments, we aimed for a sample size of 25–30 individuals because significant differences are easily detected at these sizes. In the case of our hybrid screen, in which hybrid flies were difficult to produce, we reduced this to 15 individuals per strain but, due to the strong reproductive isolation between species, some genotypes were difficult to cross withD. sechellia, resulting in a lower sample size. For image analyses, we obtained images from five brains from each strain per treatment, because this allowed for parallel processing of multiple genotypes and time points. For both behavioural assays and image analyses, data were collected and analysed blind to treatment (species, genotype, sampling time and so on). We did not randomize within experiments, but instead ran all genotypes in parallel for all experiments, with the exception of the hybrid screen, in which the behaviour of hybrids was measured as offspring were successfully obtained from crosses. In this case, test hybrid behaviour was measured at least once in parallel to control hybrids and parental strains. For all experiments, flies were 3–5 days old at the start of the experiment.
