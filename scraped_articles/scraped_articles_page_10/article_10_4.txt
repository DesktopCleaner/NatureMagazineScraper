*** Early plant responses to different stress situations often encompass cytosolic Ca2+increases, plasma membrane depolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species1,2,3. However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca2+conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca2+elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca2+influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.04. Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca2+signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca2+signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals.

*** When threatened, sessile plants respond rapidly with metabolic switches and genetic reprogramming to environmental cues5,6,7. Electrical, cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals are among the earliest plant reactions observed with stressors as diverse as wounding, pathogen attack, water and salt stress, and are suggested to be intertwined1,2,3. After pathogen attack or wounding, jasmonic acid (JA) is rapidly synthesized, playing a crucial role in balancing plant growth and defence. In this trade-off scenario, JA and salicylic acid (SA) act antagonistically in the control of immunity and programmed cell death (PCD)8,9. A ROS burst precedes PCD playing a crucial role in pathogen defence10. Conversely, abscisic acid (ABA) governs drought and salt stress by regulating the plant water status when turgor pressure declines. This simplified view of hormonal control is in fact much more complicated. Mutual control of the phytohormones and second messengers involved is challenging to dissect. This optogenetics study aimed to investigate the role of [Ca2+]cyt- and anion-efflux-induced electrical signals in encoding specificity in plant processes by individually triggering them by means of light-gated ion channels.

*** Microbial rhodopsins are light-sensitive proteins and powerful tools for minimally invasive manipulation of cells by light (optogenetics)11,12. These optogenetic tools have recently been made available for use in plants4,13. ACR1 2.0 triggers defined membrane depolarizations by anion efflux and guides pollen tubes when stimulated locally4or initiates stomatal closure through depolarization-synchronized anion and cation efflux14. So far, the role of [Ca2+]cytsignals in plants has been studied with loss-of-function approaches of Ca2+-signalling elements or Ca2+-permeable channels15,16. Here we established an approach equivalent to a gain-of-function strategy, a light-gated channel with on–off features allowing defined [Ca2+]cytmodifications.

*** Channelrhodopsins are light-gated cation channels with a broad selectivity for cations17,18. Previously, we engineered a channelrhodopsin variant with extra expression and medium long open time (XXM)19and pronounced Ca2+permeability20. Here we screened a set of XXM mutants and identified an extra H134Q substitution in XXM (XXM 1.1) that augments photocurrents and Ca2+conductance (Fig.1a–cand Extended Data Fig.1a–d). Endoplasmic reticulum-export and plasma membrane-targeting signal peptides in XXM 1.2 and XXM 1.3 further improved membrane targeting and photocurrents inXenopus laevisoocytes, and an N-terminal 11 amino acid truncation in XXM 1.3 led to the final XXM 2.0 version (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.1a,e).

*** XXM 2.0 was cloned into a plant expression vector providing for in planta production of all-transretinal, the essential chromophore of rhodopsin4(Extended Data Fig.1a). Retinal synthesis did not affect carotenoid content or plant growth under non-stimulating red light conditions when compared to wild-type (WT) plants (Extended Data Fig.2a–f). The broad XXM 2.0 action spectrum (Extended Data Fig.1f) permits green light stimulation, minimizing interference with plant photoreceptor signalling21,22. Compared to Ret-XXM 1.2 or 1.3, Ret-XXM 2.0 exhibited improved plasma membrane targeting and stronger membrane depolarizations when stimulated with green light (Fig.1d–gand Extended Data Fig.2g–i). This probably resulted from pronounced cation influx and Ca2+-dependent alteration of endogenous ion transport23. No notable light response was induced in WT or control plants expressing the retinal-producing enzyme and soluble enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Ret-eYFP; Fig.1e–gand Extended Data Fig.1a).

*** In contrast to Ret-eYFP or Ret-ACR1 2.0, Ret-XXM 2.0 elicited a substantial increase in [Ca2+]cytinNicotiana benthamianaleaves expressing the aequorin Ca2+sensor24(Fig.1h). Using the red fluorescent Ca2+sensor R-GECO125and the pH reporter pHuji26, we observed sustained [Ca2+]cytelevations but only minor, short-lived pH deflections with Ret-XXM 2.0 at cellular resolution (Fig.1i, Extended Data Fig.3a,band Supplementary Video1). Simultaneous electrical recordings and [Ca2+]cytimaging revealed that light-induced Ret-XXM 2.0-dependent [Ca2+]cytsignals were accompanied by reproducible membrane depolarizations and both could be fine-tuned by light intensity or duration (Extended Data Fig.3c–i). Ret-ACR1 2.0 triggered membrane depolarizations too, but no sustained [Ca2+]cytincreases (Extended Data Fig.4a). For physiological investigations we finally developed a global light-application protocol (520 nm, 9 µW mm−2) to induce membrane depolarizations or Ca2+influx in plant leaf cells stably expressing Ret-ACR1 2.0 or Ret-XXM 2.0 (hereafter referred to as ACR1 and XXM; Fig.2a,band Extended Data Fig.4b).

*** Source Data

*** When exposed to continuous global low-intensity green light illumination, XXM plants developed necrotic spots after 24 h (Fig.2cand Extended Data Fig.5a,b). In support of a pathogen-associated PCD27response governed by Ca2+signalling, the necrotic phenotype was suppressed by chelating extracellular Ca2+(Extended Data Fig.5c,d). A nonlinear increase in apoplastic conductivity further indicated that PCD develops about 4–8 h after XXM activation (Fig.2d). By contrast, ACR1 triggered steady anion release from mesophyll cells, resulting in a linear increase in ion leakage towards the apoplast and plant wilting after 4 h continuous low-intensity green light illumination (Fig.2c,dand Extended Data Figs.5e–jand6a). The rapid recovery of leaf turgor within 20 min after ACR1 shut-off (Supplementary Video2) supports the idea that the wilting phenotype results from reversible leaf cell water loss initiated by ACR1-driven anion efflux and concomitant potassium release through depolarization-activated K+channels14.

*** Watering plants with 35% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) mimicked the wilting time course observed in ACR1 plants (Extended Data Fig.5e–j) and provided suitable experimental conditions for analysing ACR1 responses in a physiological context. Similarly, infection withPseudomonas syringaepv. tomatostrain DC3000 (Pst) was utilized as a suitable physiological control, reproducing the phenotypic characteristics observed with XXM (Extended Data Fig.5a,b).

*** Nicotiana tabacumleaves inoculated withPsttriggered robust [Ca2+]cytincreases (Extended Data Fig.6b,c). As Ca2+-dependent ROS production is key for plant immunity and abiotic stress signalling10,28,29, we monitored ROS production. We observed strong and progressive ROS generation in leaves 4 h after XXM stimulation as well asPstinoculation. ROS production, however, was significantly lower in leaves of ACR1 or PEG-treated plants compared to XXM leaves and was barely detectable in control leaves (Fig.2eand Extended Data Fig.6d–g). In vivo quantitative real-time amperometric H2O2measurements revealed a rapid H2O2transient, reaching peak values of 15 µM within 4 min following light stimulation in XXM leaves, that levelled down to sustained steady-state values of 4–5 µM and returned to control levels upon light off (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.6f). The H2O2signal lagging about 1 min behind the XXM-induced [Ca2+]cytincrease and depolarization (Extended Data Fig.6h–j) supports voltage- or Ca2+-dependent ROS production. Despite comparable amplitudes of electrical signals triggered by both optotools, ACR1 provoked only a small ROS rise of about 1 µM after 1 h stimulation (Extended Data Fig.6f). Thus, our data support Ca2+-dependent profound H2O2production in plants30.

*** The observed phenotypes indicated that XXM and ACR1 address signalling pathways related to immune responses and osmotic stress, respectively. The phytohormone ABA is central to drought adaptation whereas the interplay of JA isoleucine (JA-Ile) and SA orchestrates defence signalling pathways29,31. In general, JA is rapidly synthesized through its intermediatecis-(+)-12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and is subsequently conjugated withl-isoleucine to its active variant JA-Ile30,32. In this context, OPDA is discussed as a signalling molecule that regulates diverse biological processes in a JA-independent manner33,34.

*** We used a targeted metabolomic approach to quantify the aforementioned marker metabolites. After 1 h, 4 h and 24 h green light treatment, ABA and proline levels increased strongly in ACR1 and PEG-treated control plants, whereas no significant changes were detected in XXM stimulated plants andPst-treated plants or red light control plants (Fig.3a–dand Extended Data Fig.7a–c). OPDA, JA, JA-Ile and SA remained at low levels in PEG-treated plants or ACR1 stimulated plants and remained at basal levels under control conditions (Fig.3e–land Extended Data Fig.7d–o). By contrast, in XXM plants JA-Ile, JA and OPDA strongly accumulated already after 1 h, returning to control levels within 4 h. In comparison, the onset of the SA transient was delayed and returned to basal levels after about 24 h (Fig.3f–h,j–land Extended Data Fig.7i–k,m–o). FollowingPstleaf inoculation, levels of JA-Ile, JA and OPDA were comparable to those of control plants, whereas SA levels increased significantly but less than with XXM stimulation (Fig.3e,i–land Extended Data Fig.7h,l). These data corroborate the phenotypes as well as the kinetics of ROS generation and ion leakage (Extended Data Figs.5a,band6a,d,e). In conclusion, spray inoculation and optotool activation seem to act on different timescales. The slow, successivePstinfection process35,36contrasts with the immediate impact of XXM stimulation, which affects all leaf cells simultaneously. This difference is evident in the unchanged SA levels observed 2 h afterPstinfection, compared to the tenfold increase in SA levels observed at the same time point following XXM stimulation (Fig.3iversus Fig.3jinset). The minor transient increase of JA-Ile and JA observed after control spray inoculation probably resulted from mechanical cues37. However, the possibility of a rapid, transient increase in JA-Ile and its precursors being missed duringPsttreatment cannot be excluded. Overall, our results probably indicate that the two different optogenetic tools addressed distinct metabolic pathways in leaves.

*** To substantiate the notion that the optogenetic tools specifically address pathogen and wounding responses with XXM and drought signalling with ACR1, we complemented our metabolite profiling with transcriptomics. For this purpose, we subjected ACR1 and XXM plants to 1 h or 4 h low-intensity green light episodes and followed transcriptome profiles along a time course of 1, 4 and 8 h (Extended Data Fig.8a).

*** Activation of either ACR1 or XXM evoked significant transcriptional reprogramming: more than 1,200 (1 h) and 2,300 (4 h) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ACR1 plants, and about 11,000 (1 h) and 13,000 (4 h) DEGs in XXM plants, respectively (Fig.4a,band Supplementary Table2, tabs 1–5). The number of DEGs rapidly declined after the light stimulus ceased, resembling optogenetic on–off switching (Fig.4a,b). In contrast to the optotools, and in line with a steady stress response manifestation during water stress38or pathogen attack35, DEGs exhibited a gradual increase over time following physiological stress (Fig.4a–dand Supplementary Table2, tabs 1–7). About 20% (1 h) and 50% (4 h) of the 1,333 DEGs addressed by drought stress (8 h PEG treated) were shared with ACR1, respectively. Similarly, 73% and 77% of 1,638 DEGs addressed by biotic stress (8 hPstinoculation) were covered by the XXM dataset (Extended Data Fig.8b,c).

The expression levels of the DEGs are represented byz-score-normalized colour scales from blue (low expression) to red (high expression).

*** Source Data

*** Gene ontology (GO)-based annotation of DEGs (plant GOSlim) revealed that abiotic (PEG8h) and biotic (Pst8h) stress responses matched best to those obtained with the 1 h stimulated ACR1 and XXM plants, respectively (Extended Data Fig.8d–gand Supplementary Table2, tab 8). Accordingly, at the level of gene function, the upregulated GO terms related to ABA signalling and water transport were enriched following ACR1 activation and 8 h PEG treatment. Conversely, biological processes related to transport and signalling of auxin were downregulated in ACR1 plants (Extended Data Fig.8f,h,iand Supplementary Table2, tabs 9–14). These results indicate that after activation, ACR1 plants face water deprivation and respond correspondingly by activating ABA signalling and biosynthesis and shutting down auxin-controlled plant growth (Extended Data Fig.8hand Supplementary Table2, tabs 9–12).

*** Biological processes associated with hormonal responses, cell recognition, immune responses and wounding were upregulated in XXM andPst-inoculated plants, whereas GO terms related to photosynthesis were downregulated (Extended Data Fig.8g,j,kand Supplementary Table2, tabs 15–20). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements corroborated a rapid shutdown of photosynthesis in light-stimulated XXM plants and to a lesser extend inPst-inoculated leaves (Extended Data Fig.9a). Compared to that forPstinoculation, the six to eight times higher number of XXM-addressed DEGs highlights the numerous genes specifically targeted by XXM. Functional classification (plant GOSlim) of these genes again identified signal transduction, stress responses and cell death as enriched upregulated biological processes whereas photosynthesis as well as growth and development were downregulated (Supplementary Table3). The observation that many upregulated XXM DEGs are involved in Ca2+signalling (Supplementary Table4), suggests that—compared to receptor-basedPstrecognition—the Ca2+-permeable optotool activates a ‘global’ Ca2+response, addressing several Ca2+-dependent pathways.

*** ACR1 and XXM shared common DEGs and GO terms (Extended Data Fig.9b–e). However, expression profiles of top regulated genes addressed by either ACR1 or XXM activation showed that genes for proline synthesis, water transport, ABA synthesis and signalling were regulated by ACR1 (Fig.4e,fand Supplementary Table5). Genes associated with photosynthesis and auxin-dependent growth regulation were repressed with both optotools (Fig.4g,h). Many genes related to JA, SA, ethylene, PCD and ROS pathways showed specific regulation in XXM plants but remained largely unchanged in ACR1 (Fig.4i–m). These involved transcriptional master regulators of JA signalling and biosynthesis (Fig.4i) that fine-tune plant immunity31. XXM-induced DEGs also included SA receptors and hub regulators (Fig.4j) essential for pathogen resistance39. Furthermore, XXM activation strongly triggered ethylene-associated plant immune responses40(Fig.4k). The overall picture that XXM, but not ACR1, activates immune responses is also reflected by specific upregulation of genes associated with ROS production and redox regulation or PCD (Fig.4l,m).

*** Green light has minor effects on photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis compared to red and blue light41,42,43. It addressed few DEGs in matureN.tabacumleaves (Supplementary Table6), making it a minimally invasive condition for rhodopsin-based optogenetic plant manipulation.

*** We introduced XXM as a new tool to orchestrate Ca2+signals and downstream signalling pathways in planta by applying tailored light protocols (Figs.1and2and Extended Data Fig.3). Of note, XXM additionally conducts Na+in animal cell systems20. In contrast to that in animal cells, the extracellular Na+concentration in non-salt-stressed plants is about 1 mM (refs.44,45), not exceeding 40 mM in the cytosol46. Given a resting potential in plant leaf cells of about −120 to −160 mV, a small inward-directed Na+movement through XXM is outcompeted by Ca2+, driven by its steep inward gradient (>10,000-fold). Experimental evidence showed that an XXM-mediated necrotic phenotype occurred in Ca2+- but not Na+-rich media (Extended Data Fig.5d). Further, typical sodium stress markers were barely induced by XXM, whereas many more genes related to Ca2+transport and signalling were upregulated (Supplementary Table4). Thus, in the plant context, the Na+conductance of XXM can be disregarded, making XXM ideal to study the role of Ca2+signals.

*** Using XXM and ACR1 side by side, we were able to tackle a long-standing question of how membrane potential changes and/or [Ca2+]cytvariations shape plant stress responses. XXM and ACR1 both trigger comparable membrane depolarizations but led to clearly separable plant stress responses (Figs.1–4). Our study allows the following interpretation: a long-term voltage change may not represent a signalling cue per se to convey specificity for the drought or immune response observed here. Instead, an ACR1-mediated light-induced hydraulic signal, resulting from anion efflux, accompanied by potassium and water efflux, initiated the drought stress response (Figs.2–4). By contrast, the XXM-mediated Ca2+influx triggered an immune response and suggests [Ca2+]cytto represent the key signal. Further studies should identify turgor sensors or Ca2+-dependent immune responses, possibly with the help of optotools. Of note, our studies are based on physiological responses observed in leaf cells, still leaving open the possibility that in distinct cell types—such as guard cells—signalling may be different47. Defined oscillations in [Ca2+]cytor membrane voltage are considered to address specific signalling networks and physiological plant responses48,49,50. Precise spatial activation of XXM or ACR1 may help to answer how [Ca2+]cyttogether with voltage signatures encodes information to communicate local and long-range stress-related cues in plants (Extended Data Fig.10). Moreover, considering the observed dynamic kinetics of optogenetically induced physiological responses (Figs.3and4and Extended Data Fig.9f–m), switching off optotools could allow for temporally resolved investigation of the underlying restoring mechanisms. Given the wilting phenotype induced by ACR1, there is potential to screen for mutants that show enhanced osmolyte uptake, making them more resistant to salt stress or drought. Overall, experimental approaches in this area would enhance our understanding of plant plasticity dynamics and resilience to changing environmental conditions.

For other constructs, all of the fragments with suitable restriction sites were introduced into the pGEMHE vector or the binary vectors pCAMBIA3300 with T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

*** Plasmid extractions fromEscherichia colicultures were carried out using the MiniPrep 250 Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructs were verified by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The sequences of XXM 1.1 and XXM 2.0 are available in theSupplementary Information.

*** ChR2-XXM (D156H) was selected as a template to start molecular engineering owing to the high expression level and already enhanced Ca2+permeability19. As no specific ion-selective filter is identified in ChR2, we anticipated that the three (extracellular, centre and intracellular) molecular gates (ECG, CG and ICG) might contribute to modulating ion-selective properties of ChR2, in addition to its gating function. Considering known substitution sites of ChR2 variants with modified ion selectivity in relation to the crystal structure indeed suggests a possibility to modulate ion selectivity using the ChR2 structure generated by PyMOL53(Extended Data Fig.1b). Within the three-dimensional structure, the internal cavities were calculated using HOLLOW, which is a published python script54. Some gating residues (H134 and E83 in ICG, and Q117 and R120 in ECG) and residues located in close proximity to the gate (E101 near ECG) were therefore substituted (Extended Data Fig.1b). S63 (when combined with D156H) and E90 substitutions in CG have been reported to decrease Ca2+conductance55,56, and therefore were not tested here. The resulting variants were first tested by two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis withX.laevisoocytes for comparison of photocurrent amplitude (Extended Data Fig.1c). Variants exhibiting high photocurrent amplitude were next studied to determine the ion selectivity (reversal potential shift comparison) by changing extracellular ion concentrations (Extended Data Fig.1d, see details in the following section) for selecting the superior candidate with high Ca2+conductance (Fig.1). To further enhance its membrane trafficking, N-terminal truncation of ChR2 and addition of signal peptides as recently reported4were explored and examined by fluorescence imaging along with a comparison of photocurrents inX.laevisoocytes.

*** The AmpliCap-MaxT7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies) was used to synthesize XXM, XXM 1.1, XXM 1.2, XXM 1.3 and XXM 2.0 complementary RNA (cRNA). All of the cRNAs were stored in nuclease-free water at −20 °C. Oocytes were injected with 30 ng cRNA and incubated in ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4) at 16 °C for 2 days. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature with a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (TURBO TEC-03X, NPI Electronic). Electrode capillaries (diameter 1.5 mm, wall thickness 0.178 mm; Hilgenberg) were pulled by a vertical puller (PC-10, Narishige) and filled with 3 M KCl, with tip resistance of 0.4–1 MΩ. A USB-6221 DAQ interface (National Instruments) and WinWCP V5.3.4 software (University of Strathclyde, UK) were used for data acquisition. Blue light illumination was supplied by a 473-nm laser (Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech).

*** Photocurrents of different XXM versions in response to blue light illumination (473 nm, 3 mW mm−2) were compared at a holding potential of −90 mV in a standard recording solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM BaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6). For the reversal potential shift (mV) comparison, photocurrents of XXM and XXM 1.1 were recorded in both buffer A (119 mMN-methyl-d-glucamine, 0.8 mM BaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6) and buffer B (80 mM BaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6). Blue light (473 nm, 3 mW mm−2) was applied to activate different XXM variants. In the experiment for the comparison of calcium currents between XXM and XXM 1.1, 10 mM 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was injected to block the endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channels of oocytes. The Ca2+currents triggered by 3 mW mm−2blue light were measured in the bath solution containing 80 mM CaCl2and 10 mM 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPSO) at pH 9 and a holding potential of −90 mV.

*** The action spectrum for XXM 2.0 was detected with light of different wavelengths. Light of different wavelengths (399.3 nm, 422 nm, 440.7 nm, 456 nm, 479.5 nm, 496 nm, 516 nm, 541 nm, 562 nm and 595 nm) was obtained by narrow bandwidth interference filters (Edmund Optics) together with a PhotoFluor II light source (89 North). Equal photon flux was set for each wavelength. Photocurrents were detected when treated with light of distinct wavelength and normalized to the maximal stationary currents triggered by blue light (456 nm). The light intensities were measured with a Plus 2 Power & Energy Meter (Laserpoint).

*** TheAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101 was collected by centrifugation after 1 day of culture and washed twice with sterile distilled water. All of the plasmids described for plant expression were transformed intoA.tumefaciensby an electroporation protocol57. Monoclonal colonies were selected from lysogeny broth (LB)–agar plates with 100 μg ml−1kanamycin, 25 μg ml−1gentamycin and 10 μg ml−1rifampicin at 28 °C and cultured in LB medium with 100 μg ml−1kanamycin, 25 μg ml−1gentamycin and 10 μg ml−1rifampicin at 28 °C. The colonies were confirmed by PCR.

*** ForAgrobacteriuminfiltration, 30–37-day-oldN.benthamianaplants grown in the greenhouse (40–60 kilolux light irradiation from 08:00–20:00, 24–26 °C) were used. Transient transformation ofN.benthamianaplants was carried out according to the protocol of ref.58. Briefly, agrobacteria were cultured in LB medium with 150 µM acetosyringone at 28 °C for about 16–18 h, collected by centrifugation and washed twice with infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH was adjusted to 5.6 by KOH), 150 μM acetosyringone). The final concentration was adjusted to 0.4 at an optical density of 600 nm (OD600nm) in infiltration buffer. A 1-ml syringe was used to infiltrate the resuspended agrobacteria into the leaves through the abaxial epidermis. The infiltrated plants were grown in 650 nm red light (light intensity of about 30 µW mm−2; cycles of 14 h light at 26 °C/10 h dark at 16 °C).

*** N.tabacum(N.tabacumcultivar Petit Havana SR1) seeds sterilized by 6% NaOCl were germinated and grown in 500-ml sterile plastic boxes on agar plates (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins and MES (Duchefa Biochemie), 3% sucrose, 0.8% Gelzan (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.8 with KOH) in stable culture conditions of cycles of 14 h light at 26 °C/10 h dark at 16 °C. TheA.tumefaciensstrain GV3101 harbouring the pCAMBIA3300 vector with BASTA resistance or the pCAMBIA1300 vector with hygromycin resistance was used forN.tabacumtransformation as described previously59with some minor modifications. Agrobacteria were collected and washed twice with sterilized MS solution (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins and MES (Duchefa Biochemie), 3% sucrose, pH 5.8 with KOH). The final concentration was adjusted to OD600nm= 0.1. Sterilized leaves were cut into pieces of about 2 cm2and soaked in the resuspended agrobacteria solution for 20 min. The wet leaf pieces were dried, placed on plant growth medium and transferred after 3 days to a callus-inducing medium (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins and MES (Duchefa Biochemie), 3% sucrose, 0.8% Gelzan (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.8 with KOH, 20 µg ml−1dl-phosphinothricin (Duchefa Biochemie) or 30 mg l−1hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 500 µg ml−1ticarcillin disodium (Duchefa Biochemie), 100 mg l−1myo-inositol, 1 mg l−1thiamine hydrochloride, 1 mg l−16-benzylaminopurine and 100 µg l−11-naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)) and cultured under 650-nm light-emitting diode (LED) red light with light intensity of about 30 µW mm−2. The pieces of leaves, explants and calli were transferred to new callus-inducing medium every 2 weeks. Generated shoots were decapitated and moved onto rooting medium (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins and MES (Duchefa Biochemie), 3% sucrose, 0.8% Gelzan (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.8 with KOH, 20 µg ml−1dl-phosphinothricin (Duchefa Biochemie) or 30 mg l−1hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 500 µg ml−1ticarcillin disodium (Duchefa Biochemie), 100 mg l−1myo-inositol, 1 mg l−1thiamine hydrochloride)) and, after root formation, were grown on soil in 650 nm red light (about 30 µW mm−2, cycles of 14 h light at 26 °C/10 h dark at 16 °C).

*** The transgenic plants were verified by eYFP fluorescence or R-GECO1 fluorescence in leaves. Seeds of individual plants were collected and selected for BASTA or hygromycin resistance using selection medium (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins and MES (Duchefa Biochemie), 3% sucrose, 0.8% Gelzan, pH 5.8 with KOH, 20 µg ml−1dl-phosphinothricin (Duchefa Biochemie) or 30 mg l−1hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). Homozygous lines were used for experimental studies.

*** A confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5, Leica Microsystems CMS) controlled by Leica LAS AF (Version 2.7.3.9723, Leica Microsystems) was used to subcellularly localize the rhodopsin–eYFP fusions in plant cells orX.laevisoocytes. The yellow fluorescence was observed with a dipping 25× HCX IRAPO 925/0.95 objective inN.benthamianaleaves 3 days postAgrobacteriuminfiltration, inN.tabacumleaves after 45 days grown in red light (light intensity of about 30 µW mm−2; cycles of 14 h light at 26 °C/10 h dark at 16 °C) and inX.laevisoocytes 2 days post injection. eYFP was excited at 496 nm and fluorescence was captured between 520 and 580 nm.N.benthamianaandN.tabacumleaf discs were placed upside down for yellow fluorescence detection. FIJI IMAGEJ-win64 software60was used for image processing.

*** Co-infiltration of agrobacteria with 10 μM of coelenterazine (PJK Biotech) was carried out as described in the ‘Agrobacteriuminfiltration ofN.benthamianaleaves’ section under red light conditions. After 2 days in the red light growth room, aequorin luminescence from the infiltrated leaves was measured by a homemade luminometer. Luminescence was detected by a photomultiplier (Photo Counting Module MP 1983 RS CPM, Perkin Elmer) controlled by IGI-MPRS232 (IGIsystems). Labview 14.0.0 (National Instruments) was used to control the shutter and LEDs. A 520-nm green light LED (from WINGER, WEPGN3-S1) with a light intensity of 50 μW mm−2was used to activate rhodopsins. To prevent the LED light from being detected by the photomultiplier, an additional shutter (Uniblitz, VCM-D1) was installed.

*** Live-cell imaging experiments were carried out using transiently transformedN.benthamianaleaves, transgenicN.tabacumleaves (Ret-XXM 2.0 with R-GECO1, Ret-ACR1 2.0 with R-GECO1, R-GECO1, Ret-XXM 2.0 with pHuji and pHuji) or transiently transformedN.benthamianamesophyll protoplasts (R-GECO1 and Ret-XXM 2.0 with R-GECO1). TheA.tumefaciensstrain GV3101 harbouring the corresponding pCAMBIA vectors andA.tumefaciensstrain K19 were cultured at 28 °C overnight. The infiltration solution for co-expression of Ret-XXM 2.0 with R-GECO1 containedA.tumefaciensstrain K19 (OD600nm= 0.3) andA.tumefaciensstrain GV3101 harbouring the pCAMBIA plasmids (pCAMBIA3300 vector carrying Ret-XXM 2.0, pCAMBIA1300 vector carrying NES-2× R-GECO1; OD600nm= 0.4 for both). Control plants were infiltrated with infiltration solution containingA.tumefaciensstrain K19 (OD600nm= 0.3) andA.tumefaciensstrain GV3101 harbouring the pCAMBIA1300 vector carrying NES-2× R-GECO1 (OD600nm= 0.4). [Ca2+]cytmeasurements were carried out 3 days post infiltration. Mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from the transiently transformedN.benthamianaleaves from which the abaxial epidermis was peeled off. The leaf pieces without the main vein were incubated in enzyme solution (1% BSA, 0.05% pectolyase Y23, 0.5% cellulase R-10, 0.5% macerozym R-10, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MES, 500 mMd-sorbitol, pH 5.6 with Tris) for 2 h. Following enzymatic digestion, cells were filtered through a 100-µm mesh. Protoplasts were collected by low-speed centrifugation (80g) without acceleration at 4 °C. Protoplasts were washed twice using precooled wash solution (1 mM CaCl2, 500 mMd-sorbitol, pH 5.6 with Tris) and finally resuspended in precooled wash solution and stored on ice until use. Leaf disc samples with a diameter of 5 mm were prepared by peeling the abaxial epidermis off and gluing leaf discs upside down with medical adhesive (ULRICH Swiss) on custom-made recording chambers. The samples were allowed to recover in the dark in bath solution (1 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MES, and 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane (BTP), pH  6.0) at room temperature (about 25 °C) overnight before R-GECO1 or pHuji fluorescence measurement and all-optical experiments were carried out.

*** The microscope setup to carry out live-cell imaging is described in detail elsewhere61. R-GECO125and pHuji26were excited with 570 nm excitation light. VisiView software (Version 2.1.1) was used to simultaneously control R-GECO1 imaging and triggering of local green light (532 nm, 180 μW mm−2) illumination by a solid-state laser (Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech) or global green light (520 nm, 9 μW mm−2) illumination by a homemade LED device (LED from WINGER, WEPGN3-S1). XXM 2.0 activation by green light was carried out in the 5 s interval time during R-GECO1 or pHuji imaging. Green light illumination was terminated more than 1 s before R-GECO1 was excited to avoid photoswitching effects of R-GECO1 during optogenetic stimulation as reported previously62. A dichroic mirror (HC593 (F38-593), AHF Analysetechnik) combined with a high-speed filter wheel equipped with bandpass filters for R-GECO1 or pHuji (ET 624/20 nm) was used to detect the red fluorescence. During the detection of [Ca2+]cytsignal triggered by XXM 2.0 stimulation when a different light condition was used, a 2 s interval time was set during R-GECO1 illuminations. It should be noted that the light pulse protocols used to set defined [Ca2+]cytsignatures must be customized for each particular cell system or plant line and cannot act as a blueprint as features such as the expression level and cell type used or the Ca2+homeostasis will probably influence the signature.

*** To avoid undesirable XXM 2.0 or ACR1 2.0 activations during bright-field imaging, the microscope white light source was covered by a primary red filter (Lee filter 106). Simultaneous plasma membrane potential and R-GECO1 fluorescence recordings were carried out in R-GECO1, Ret-XXM 2.0 with R-GECO1, Ret-ACR1 2.0 with R-GECO1 samples. Current-clamp-based voltage recordings were carried out by microelectrode impalement as described elsewhere61. Glass microelectrodes filled with 300 mM KCl were connected to the microelectrode amplifier (TEC-05X; NPI Electronic) equipped with head stages of more than 1013Ω input impedance. The reference electrodes were filled with 300 mM KCl. A piezo-driven micromanipulator (Sensapex) was used to direct the glass electrode. The current-clamp protocols were applied by WinWCP V5.3.4 software (University of Strathclyde, UK). R-GECO1 fluorescence intensities were recorded using FIJI IMAGEJ-win64 software60.

*** Ca2+signals were detected inN.tabacumleaves utilizing the R-GECO1 reporter followingPsttreatment using a perfusion system (780 μl min−1), which prevents motion and touch-induced imaging artefacts47,63,64,65.Pstinoculated from LB–agar plates containing 10 µg ml−1rifampicin was cultured in LB medium with 10 µg ml−1rifampicin for 1.5 days (28 °C, 200 r.p.m.) and subsequently subcultured in 500 ml LB medium containing 10 µg ml−1rifampicin for 16 h.Pstcells were washed twice using sterile deionized water and suspended in bath solution (1 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MES and BTP, pH 6.0), resulting in a final perfusion solution with an OD600nmof 0.5. Leaf disc samples from R-GECO1 transgenicN.tabacumplants without abaxial epidermis were glued with the adaxial side down to the coverslip in custom-made chambers using Medical Adhesive B (Ulrich Swiss) and allowed to recover in bath solution overnight before Ca2+imaging.

*** Microelectrodes for mesophyll cell impalement were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (inner diameter 0.58 mm, outer diameter 1.0 mm, Hilgenberg) using a horizontal laser puller (P2000, Sutter). Microelectrodes filled with 300 mM KCl having an electrode resistance of 60–110 MΩ were connected by Ag/AgCl wires to the microelectrode amplifier (Axon geneclamp 500 or VF-102; BioLogic). Reference electrodes were filled with 300 mM KCl, and plugged with 2% agar in 300 mM KCl. The NA USB-6221 interface (National Instruments) was used to digitalize data. Cells were impaled by an electronic micromanipulator (NC-30, Kleindiek Nanotechnik) and current-clamp protocols were applied with the WinWCP V5.3.4 software (University of Strathclyde, UK).

*** All of the WT and transgenicN.tabacumplants were grown under constant red light (650 nm, 30 μW mm−2, 26 °C) for 45 days. For ACR1 2.0 and XXM 2.0 stimulation, 0 h, 1 h, 4 h and 24 h additional global green light (520 nm, 9 μW mm−2) were applied for the experimental groups. For osmotic stress treatment, 35% PEG was used to water Ret-eYFP #1 transgenicN.tabacumplants. This PEG concentration was selected after initial experiments with different PEG concentrations that would cause wilting phenotypes in a similar time frame (after 4–5 h) to that for the green-light-treated Ret-ACR1 2.0 plants. ForPsttreatment, thePstwas washed twice with sterile deionized water and suspended in 10 mM MgCl2containing 0.04% Silwet L-77 with a final OD600nmof 0.5 and sprayed on the entire Ret-eYFP #1 transgenicN.tabacumplants.Psttreatment was applied by spray inoculation to prevent wounding effects taking place that would unequivocally occur during infiltration by a syringe. The same amount (about 25 ml for each plant) of 10 mM MgCl2containing 0.04% Silwet L-77 was sprayed on Ret-eYFP #1 transgenicN.tabacumas the negative control. Att= 0 h before the additional green light illumination, PEG,Pstor 10 mM MgCl2was applied. For plants treated with 0 h, 1 h and 4 h green light illumination, the fifth leaves ofN.tabacumwere collected at different time points (t= 0 h, 1 h, 4 h and 8 h) and frozen in liquid nitrogen quickly for metabolite measurement and transcriptomics analysis. For plants treated with 24 h global green light, PEG,Pstor 10 mM MgCl2, the fifth leaves fromN.tabacumat different time points (t= 0 min, 3 min, 10 min, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8h and 24 h) were used for detection and quantification of ROS, electrolyte leakage estimations, chlorophyll fluorescence detection, metabolite measurement and transcriptomics analysis.

*** A tissue puncher (Stiefel Disposable biopsy punch, diameter of 6 mm) was used to prepare leaf discs from the fifth leaf of 45-day-oldN.tabacumplants. Leaf discs were washed twice with deionized water and transferred into 24-well plates containing 0.4 ml ultrapure H2O that contained 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EGTA (pH 7.0, KOH), 5 mM K4BAPTA or 5 mM K4BAPTA plus 10 mM NaCl as indicated in Extended Data Fig.5c,d. Samples were placed in the dark for 1 h before exposing them to the light condition (growth chamber with constant red light (650 nm, 30 μW mm−2) plus constant green light (520 nm, 9 µW mm−2, 26 °C)). Images were captured after 24 h treatment.

*** N.tabacumplants treated as described in the ‘Plant growth conditions and sample collection’ section were used to quantify photosynthesis performance with a pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer. The fifth leaf was fixed and monitored with a Maxi pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer (AVT 033); chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were recorded with IMAGING WIN v.2.41a FW MULTI RGB (Walz). The dark-adaptedN.tabacumleaf was exposed to actinic light with intensity 7 (photosynthetically active radiation as 146 μmol m−2s−1). The maximal fluorescence yield of a dark-adapted sample (Fm) and dark-level fluorescence yield (Fo) were detected. The quantum yield of the dark-adapted leaf samples is a measure of the potential quantum yield of the samples, which was calculated according to the equation: Yield = (Fm − Fo)/Fm.

*** The membrane integrity ofN.tabacumleaf cells was estimated by electrolyte leakage of leaf samples. Ion conductivity was measured as described previously66. Seven leaf discs (5 mm diameter) were detached from the fifth leaves of 45-day-old plants and equilibrated together in 0.3 ml of ultrapure H2O after washing twice with ultrapure H2O. Ion conductivity was quantified 20 min after leaf disc equilibration in ultrapure H2O (EC1) using a LAQUAtwin EC-11 conductivity meter (Horiba). The samples were then heated at 99 °C for 1 h to measure the final electrical conductivity (EC2) when the samples reached room temperature again. The relative electrolyte leakage was calculated, as a percentage, by the formula: EL = EC1/EC2 × 100.

*** Chemical detection of ROS in green light (520 nm, 9 μW mm−2)-treatedN.tabacumleaves was carried out by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich) staining as described previously67. The fifth leaves ofN.tabacumplants were stained with fresh DAB staining solution (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mg ml−1DAB, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 3.0) by application of negative pressure for 5 min in dark. After 5 h incubation (shaking speed of 80–100 r.p.m.), the stained leaves were moved into fresh chlorophyll destaining solution (ethanol/acetic acid/glycerol, 3:1:1) and bathed in hot water (about 90–95 °C) for 15 min. Finally, the stained leaves were put into cold fresh chlorophyll destaining solution for 30 min. Images were taken with a plain white background under uniform lighting.

*** The chemiluminescent ‘superoxide probe’ luminol can be applied to indicate the ROS production68. Superoxide released from leaf tissues was detected by the luminescence of luminol with Skanlt software (Version 6.1) according to the method described previously69with minor modifications. Leaf discs were prepared from the fifth leaves of 45-day-oldN.tabacumplants using a tissue puncher (Stiefel Disposable biopsy punch, diameter of 6 mm). Leaf discs were washed with deionized water twice and transferred into the 96-well assay plate (black plate, clear bottom with lid, Corning) and incubated in the dark overnight to recover. Water was replaced with 200 µl of luminol–peroxidase working solution (30 mg l−1luminol (Sigma) and 20 mg l−1horseradish peroxidase (Sigma)) in each well containing leaf discs. Samples were kept in the dark for 1 h before measurement. Luminescence was measured in a microplate reader (Luminoskan Ascent, Thermo Labsystems) and 5 min global constant green light (9 µW mm−2) illumination was applied during the rest periods.

*** The method for in vivo measuring the production of H2O2amperometrically from mesophyll cells in parallel with intracellular membrane potential recordings was described previously70. Measurements were carried out in standard bath solution (1 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MES, and BTP, pH 6.0) with a platinum–iridium electrode (MicroProbes) cut back to an active (uninsulated) area of about 1 mm length. ROS detection was carried out by Patch-Master software V2x90 (HEKA). The platinum–iridium disc was gently placed in close proximity to mesophyll cells and held at a constant voltage of 600 mV with an amperometry amplifier (VA 10X, NPI Electronic). Oxidation of H2O2at the active microelectrode surface resulted in a positive current signal, which was low-pass-filtered at 1 Hz and recorded with Patch-Master software V2x90 (HEKA). The electrode was calibrated in freshly prepared bath solutions with defined H2O2concentrations. Green light (520 nm, about 9 µW mm−2) illumination on theN.tabacumleaves was carried out by green LEDs (WINGER, WEPGN3-S1).

*** All-transretinal and carotenoids were measured according to a protocol published elsewhere4. The fifth leaf of transgenicN.tabacumplants grown for 45 days in red light was triturated in liquid nitrogen and 200 mg leaf material was extracted with 500 µl of chloroform. The extract was centrifuged for 5 min at 18,400gand 50 µl of the organic phase was evaporated in a SpeedVac at 40 °C and dissolved in 50 µl of a 1:1 ethanol and chloroform mixture. A 5 µl volume of dissolved solution was analysed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with ultraviolet and tandem mass spectrometry detection using a Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface. Ten plants were used for retinal and 12 plants were used for carotenoid quantification.

*** All of the samples were prepared as described in the ‘Plant growth conditions and sample collection’ section. Ground samples (150 mg) were lyophilized in a laboratory freeze dryer (CHRIST, Laboratory freeze dryer Alpha 1-2) and subsequently used for phytohormone extraction. The extraction and chromatographic separation was carried out as described previously71, using 5 ng of dihydro-JA, JA–norvaline, [18O2]OPDA, [D4]SA and [D6]ABA as phytohormone internal standard. The extraction solution contained ethylacetate (p.a.) and formic acid (p.a.) (99:1 in volume) to which 5 ng phytohormone internal standard was added. All samples were fixed on a TissueLyser with shaking for 3 min at a speed of 23 Hz. After that, samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac at 45 °C and finally dissolved in 40 μl liquid (acetonitrile (for high-performance liquid chromatography)/water (MilliQ), 1:1 (v/v)). Phytohormones were analysed by UPLC–electrospray interface–tandem mass spectrometry using a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system coupled to an AB Sciex 6500+ QTRAP tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex), operated in negative ionization mode as described elsewhere72,73. Analyst (Version 1.6.3) software and MultiQuant (Version 3.0.2) software from Sciex were used for mass spectrometry detection of hormones and metabolites.

*** The proline content ofN.tabacumleaves was measured according to the spectroscopic method of ref.74. Samples were prepared as described in the section ‘Plant growth conditions and sample collection’. Ground samples (150 mg) were lyophilized in a laboratory freeze dryer (CHRIST, Laboratory freeze dryer Alpha 1-2). The dry samples were mixed in 40% ethanol and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,500gfor 5 min. A 500 µl volume of the ethanol extraction or 100 µl standard solution was mixed with 1,000 µl reaction mix (1% ninhydrin (w/v) in 60% acetic acid (v/v) and 20% ethanol (v/v)). After incubation at 95 °C for 20 min and subsequent centrifugation for 1 min at 9,000g, the samples (supernatant) were subjected to absorption measurement at 520 nm with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-1500). Proline concentration was determined according to the standard curve, and concentrations were calculated on the basis of dry weight.

*** Three replicates of leaf samples from two batches ofN.tabacumplants were collected for RNA sequencing. The experimental design for transcriptomics is shown in Extended Data Fig.8a. Samples at 0 h, 1 h, 4 h and 8 h from plants growing in red light conditions were used as the biological controls to compare the expression levels of Ret-XXM 2.0 and Ret-ACR1 2.0 transgenic plants during or after the global green light illumination. In these experiments PEG-treated plants andPstinoculation served as possible physiological controls to ACR1 2.0 and XXM 2.0 activation, and spraying leaves with buffer (MgCl2) served as an additional control toPst-sprayed plants (Extended Data Fig.8a). RNA extraction was carried out using ground samples (150 mg) with the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/UM/UM_TotalRNAPlant_Rev_07.pdf). DNase1 (Thermo Fisher) was used to digest DNA. RNA sequencing was carried out by Novogene (UK) with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. Paired-end 150 bp was the read length. Data processing (fastp) and mapping to theN.tabacumgenome (kallisto)75was carried out using Amalgkit (https://github.com/kfuku52/amalgkit). Functional annotations ofN.tabacumgenes for subsequent bioinformatic analyses were retrieved from the Dicots PLAZA 5.0 repository76,77.

*** Normalization and DEG analysis were carried out employing the DIANE package using DESeq2 and default parameters77. DESeq2 uses a Wald test, in which the shrunken estimate of log fold change is divided by the standard error to produce az-statistic. Thisz-statistic is then compared against a standard normal distribution78. A prefiltering step eliminated genes exhibiting rowMeans over all conditions ≤ 5 counts, reducing the number of input genes from 69,500 to 42,196. Unless stated otherwise, |log2[fold change]| ≥ 2 with a false discovery rate of 0.01 was taken as the cutoff for DEG identification. Only a small number of DEGs were identified when comparing Ret-ACR1 2.0 or Ret-XXM 2.0 transgenes with Ret-eYFP control plants grown under non-stimulating red light conditions (Supplementary Table2, tab 1), demonstrating that ACR1 and XXM expression have virtually no impact on the transcript profiles of plants and plants growing in red light conditions are proper biological controls. Likewise, GO enrichment analysis on DEGs was carried out using the DIANE suite and corresponding enrichment plots were created using the srplot web interface (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/en). Venn diagrams were generated with the GOVenn script of the GOPlot package79and subsequent GO analysis on Venn subsets was carried out using gprofiler280. g:Profiler functional enrichment analysis is conducted using the g:GOSt tool that carries out over-representation analysis via the hypergeometric test80. Finally, heat maps were generated with the pheatmap R package (version 1.0.12;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap).N.tabacumgenes were further annotated manually according to theirA. thalianaorthologues81and corresponding gene symbols from the Aramemnon database82.

*** Quantification of gene transcripts was carried out by real-time PCR as described elsewhere83. The samples were prepared as described in the section ‘Plant growth conditions and sample collection’. Ground samples (100 mg) were used for RNA extraction by the NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 g of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). All quantitative real-time PCR reactions were carried out with the Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex 2 system and Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex (Version 2.2) software, in a 20 µl reaction volume containing 2 µl diluted cDNA, 0.8 µM primer pairs and 10 µl ABsolute qPCR SYBR Green Capillary Mix (Thermo Scientific). Information on the genes and primers used is provided in Supplementary Table7. Transcripts were normalized to that of 10,000 molecules of actin.

*** The design for long-range electrical signal measurements inN.tabacumleaves is shown in a diagram in Extended Data Fig.10a. The surface potential recordings were carried out on 6–7-week-oldN.tabacumleaves according to a previously described protocol84with minor modifications. A USB-6221 interface (National Instruments) was used to digitalize the electrical signals, which were recorded with WinWCP V5.3.4 software (University of Strathclyde, UK). The electrode silver wires (Ag/AgCl) connected to a microelectrode amplifier (Axon geneclamp 500) were wrapped around the petiole of the fifth leaves gently. Electrode gel (Auxynhairol) was used to cover the surface of the wrapped wires to aid connectivity between the electrodes and the petiole. The reference electrode consisting of an Ag/AgCl electrode was placed in a 200-ml pipette tip filled with electrode gel (Auxynhairol), which was inserted in the soil of the pots theN.tabacumplants grew in. Nine hours after mounting the electrodes, the surface potential was recorded when applying a 600-ms green light (532 nm, 5.3 mW mm−2) pulse at the main vein. A popular Technology Enhanced Clad Silica multimode optical fibre (diameter of 1,500 µm, 0.39 NA, Thorlabs) was placed directly on the top of main vein for light application. To prevent scattering of light and to guarantee local green light application, the optical fibre was covered by a non-transparent black plastic pipe up to the tip. The electrical signals were monitored at exactly 5 cm away from the illumination spot.

*** Student’st-test or ANOVA was used to analyse significant differences between groups. Significance analysis among more than three groups was carried out with one-way ANOVA using IBM SPSS statistics (version 26.0). For the post hoc multiple comparisons, the homogeneity of variances was tested first. If the variances were homogeneous (P> 0.05), the Tukey test was used for significance analysis. If the variances were not homogeneous (P< 0.05), either the Dunnett T3 or Games-Howell test was chosen, depending on whether the sample sizes were equal or not. Different letters indicate significant differences among the samples (lowercase letters indicatePvalues at the 0.05 level and capital letters indicatePvalues at the 0.01 level). Significance analysis among two groups was carried out with a two-sided Student’st-test. *P≤ 0.05, **P≤ 0.01 and ***P≤ 0.001. The significance analysis is performed with a 95% confidence of interval. All of thePvalues are listed in Supplementary Table8.
