*** Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis1. Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-functionTNFvariant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells2from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis3. Human TNF is required for respiratory-burst-dependent immunity toMycobacterium tuberculosisin macrophages but is surprisingly redundant otherwise, including for inflammation and immunity to weakly virulent mycobacteria and many other infectious agents.

*** Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is characterized by clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as environmental mycobacteria or Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccines, in otherwise healthy individuals4. Patients are also vulnerable to the more virulentM. tuberculosisand other intramacrophagic microorganisms1. MSMD is typically ‘isolated’ but can be ‘syndromic’ when associated with the frequent occurrence of at least one other phenotype, infectious or otherwise5. With one possible exception (ZNFX1 deficiency), all known genetic defects causing MSMD affect interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated immunity6. Variants of MSMD-causing genes disrupt the production of IFNγ (IFNG,IL12B,IL12RB1,IL12RB2,IL23R,ISG15,MCTS1,RORC,TBX21,TYK2), the response to IFNγ (CYBB,JAK1,IFNGR1,IFNGR2,STAT1,USP18) or both (IRF1,IRF8,NEMO,SPPL2A), or the recruitment of monocytes (CCR2)7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. The penetrance and severity of mycobacterial disease are inversely correlated with levels of IFNγ activity, demonstrating that human IFNγ activity is a quantitative trait that governs antimycobacterial immunity15.

*** The phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme16. The production of ROS, including superoxide (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is crucial for the phagocytic control of ingested bacteria, fungi and parasites3. Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in genes encoding the NADPH oxidase complex underlie chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inborn error of immunity (IEI) characterized by impaired or abolished ROS production in phagocytes17. CGD may be caused by variants affecting the core protein gp91phox(encoded byCYBB) or one of its subunits (CYBA,CYBC1,NCF1,NCF2andNCF4). Patients with CGD are highly vulnerable to severe and/or recurrent infections with various pathogens, including mycobacteria such as BCG andM. tuberculosis18,19. Notably, patients with specific hypomorphic germline variants inCYBBselectively affecting ROS production in MDMs are highly susceptible to BCG disease or clinical tuberculosis (TB) but display no increase in the risk of other infections typically seen in patients with CGD20, suggesting that ROS production by macrophages is crucial for protective immunity to tuberculous mycobacteria.

*** It has been estimated that about 25% of the global population is infected withM. tuberculosis, but only 5–10% of infected individuals develop TB. The development of TB is strongly influenced by human genetic determinants as suggested by early genetic studies21,22. The frequency of BCG disease is about 1 in 50,000 individuals, implying thatM. tuberculosisis at least 1,000 times more virulent than BCG. All patients with the MSMD phenotype with or without an MSMD genotype, and probably even all patients with an MSMD genotype with or without the MSMD phenotype, are therefore highly susceptible toM. tuberculosis23. Two rare monogenic IEIs have been reported to underlie TB in multiple kindreds: autosomal recessive (AR) complete IL-12Rβ1 and AR TYK2 deficiencies24,25. Homozygosity for the commonTYK2P1104Aallele is the most common and penetrant aetiology of TB, underlying up to 1% of TB cases in European populations4,26. Finally, we recently described AR PD-1 deficiency and AR ITK deficiency as genetic aetiologies of TB27,28. Other IEIs, such as STAT1 gain of function (GOF)29, STAT3 GOF and PIK3CD GOF, also seem to confer a predisposition to TB, albeit through unknown mechanisms5. In this context, we studied two first-cousin Colombian adults with unexplained recurrent pulmonary TB but no adverse reaction to live BCG vaccination.

*** We studied two related patients from a large consanguineous family from Colombia (Fig.1a; see the ‘Extended case reports for P1 and P2’ section of theMethods). P1 is a 28-year-old woman. She was diagnosed with pulmonary TB at the age of 19 years, presenting with dry cough, pleuritic pain, fever (40 °C), night sweats, dyspnoea and unexplained weight loss. Chest X rays and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple pulmonary micronodules and nodular lesions in the right lung (Fig.1b). A segmental lobectomy of the right upper lobe was performed (Fig.1c–e). Histological analysis showed well-constituted, paucibacillary granulomas, some of which were necrotic (Fig.1d). Immunostaining for CD3, CD4 and CD8 revealed a retention of T cells at the granuloma site and Ziehl–Neelsen staining detected acid-fast bacteria (Fig.1c,e). Cultures of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pulmonary nodule samples were positive forM. tuberculosis. The patient was treated for 12 months with isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) (HRZE), leading to complete remission. Then, 14 months later, P1 was again diagnosed with pulmonary TB. HRZE treatment was administered for 30 days, resulting in complete remission. At the age of 22 years, at 28 weeks of pregnancy, P1 was hospitalized for septic shock, presenting with leukocytosis (25.7 × 109cells per litre) with neutrophilia (18.80 × 109cells per litre), high C-reactive protein concentration (CRP; 8.7 mg dl−1) and persistent fever (>38 °C). Clinical chorioamnionitis necessitated an emergency caesarean section. Blood cultures were positive forListeria monocytogenes. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin for 7 days, with a favourable outcome.

The MSC is indicated by a dotted line.

*** P2 is a 36-year-old man and first cousin of P1. At the age of 18 years, he presented with left pulmonary TB with pleural effusion, which was treated for 6 months with HRZE. Then, 8 months later, he was hospitalized due to a relapse of TB.

*** No other unusual infections were reported in P1 or P2. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) were positive for both patients, but negative for their parents and the brother of P1. Both patients were vaccinated with BCG (Pasteur strain) without adverse effects. None of their relatives had any history of severe infectious disease. VirScan analysis of P1 and P2 confirmed normal antibody repertoires against common pathogens, demonstrating intact T cell and B cell functions for seroconversion after vaccination and immunity to common infections (Extended Data Fig.1aand Extended Data Table1). Blood samples from the patients contained no autoantibodies neutralizing type I or type II interferons, IL-12p70, IL-23 or TNF itself (Extended Data Fig.1b–e).

*** We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and genome-wide linkage analysis of P1, P2, their parents and P1’s unaffected brother. Principal component analysis of the WES data confirmed the Colombian ancestry of these individuals (Extended Data Fig.1f). The high homozygosity rates of P1 (1.14%) and P2 (2.1%) confirmed parental consanguinity. Assuming genetic homogeneity, we searched for AR genetic aetiologies (Extended Data Fig.1g). By filtering for non-synonymous variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of <0.01 in gnomAD v.2.1.1 and a combined annotation dependent-depletion (CADD) score above the mutation significance cut-off (MSC), we identified a 20-nucleotide insertion (c.190_191ins20) in exon 2 ofTNFcommon to the two patients (Extended Data Tables2and3). This insertion results in a frameshift, generating a 12-amino-acid extension and a premature stop codon 13 amino acids downstream (p.P64Lfs*13) (Fig.1f). Genome-wide linkage analysis yielded a maximum logarithm of the odds score for a region encompassingTNFon chromosome 6 (Extended Data Fig.1h). Sanger sequencing confirmed that the patients were homozygous for the variant, whereas their unaffected relatives were heterozygous (Fig.1aand Extended Data Fig.1i). TNF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced principally by macrophages as a transmembrane precursor organized into stable homotrimers. This membrane-integrated form is then cleaved by a metalloprotease, leaving an N-terminal fragment and a soluble, secreted C-terminal fragment30(Fig.1f). The variant present in the patients is predicted to affect both TNF fragments, as the resulting frameshift and premature stop codon lead to a loss of the TACE-cleavage site. The p.P64Lfs*13 variant is private and is predicted to be deleterious, with a CADD score of 22.5, well above the MSC forTNF(Fig.1g). Five other variants are present in the homozygous state in the BRAVO/TOPmed freeze 8, ATAV, ExAC and gnomAD v.2.1.1 databases and there are only two predicted LOF (pLOF) variants of this gene in gnomAD v.2.1.1, with a cumulative MAF of 8.27 × 10−6(Fig.1g). No individuals homozygous for pLOF variants were found in gnomAD or any other public WES database.TNFhas a gene damage index of 0.55, a residual variation intolerance score of −0.189 and a probability of LOF intolerance of 0.8, all suggestive of a high degree of intolerance to protein-truncating variants. Consistently, the consensus negative selection score ofTNFis low (−0.98)31. Together, these findings suggest that the private c.190_191ins20TNFvariant is deleterious and that it may underlie recurrent TB in these two patients.

*** We investigated the effect ofTNFvariants on protein levels by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells with wild-type (WT) or variantTNF. The previously described p.Y163H and p.A221R variants32, which encode proteins that do not bind to TNFR1 and TNFR2, and the p.V77* variant, were used as negative controls. Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates resulted in the detection of the full-length (25 kDa) TNF and a cleaved N-terminal fragment (15 kDa) for the WT, whereas only a 15 kDa protein was detected for the p.P64Lfs*13 variant (Extended Data Fig.2a). An antibody directed against the C terminus detected two bands for the WT, corresponding to the full-length TNF and the cleaved C-terminal fragment, whereas no bands were detected for the p.P64Lfs*13 variant, ruling out reinitiation of translation. No increase in TNF levels was observed in the supernatant of HEK293T cells transfected with the patients’ variant (Extended Data Fig.2b). We evaluated the function of the proteins encoded by the various TNF variants, by assessing the capacity of supernatants from transfected HEK293T cells to induce NF-κB-dependent transcription in a luciferase reporter assay (Fig.2a). No induction of luciferase activity was detected after treatment with the supernatants of cells transfected with the patients’ variant, whereas strong luciferase activity was observed after treatment with the supernatants of cells transfected with the WT or public variants. Thus, in contrast to the five variants found in the homozygous state in public databases, the patients’ variant abolishes the secretion of mature TNF and is LOF.

*** We evaluated the effect of the patients’ biallelicTNFvariant on mRNA and protein levels in Epstein–Barr-virus-transformed B (EBV-B) andHerpesvirus saimiri-transformed T (HVS-T) cell lines from P1. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis of the EBV-B cells of P1 showed normalTNFmRNA expression (Extended Data Fig.3c,d). Western blot analysis, using antibodies directed against the N terminus of TNF, of whole-cell lysates and supernatants from the EBV-B and HVS-T cells of P1 and healthy controls revealed the presence of a truncated protein in the cells of P1, whereas no protein was detected when using antibodies directed against the C terminus of TNF (Fig.2b). Intracellular flow cytometry staining for TNF on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-stimulated HVS-T and EBV-B cells confirmed the absence of TNF expression in the cells of P1 (Fig.2c). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of supernatants from control and patient EBV-B cells also showed that P1’s cells did not secrete TNF (Fig.2d). Lentiviral transduction of P1’s EBV-B cells with WTTNFrescued TNF production and function (Fig.2d,e). These data confirm that the patients’ variant impairs TNF production and abolishes TNF secretion and that the patients therefore have AR complete TNF deficiency. The occurrence of TB in patients on TNF blockade is well documented, suggesting that these two patients had TB because of their TNF deficiency33. Together, these findings suggest that the TNF genotype is causal for the TB phenotype after exposure toM. tuberculosis.

*** TNF is produced principally by mononuclear myeloid cells in response to microbial stimuli (Fig.2f). We measured the TNF production of primary myeloid cells from P1 in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), BCG orL. monocytogenes. Intracellular TNF levels increased in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) of healthy controls after stimulation (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.3a,b). By contrast, no TNF production was observed in any of the myeloid subsets from P1 or in classical monocytes from P2 (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.3b). Consistently, TNF was undetectable in the supernatants of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from P1 or IFNγ + BCG-stimulated whole blood from both patients (Fig.2gand Extended Data Fig.3c). The production and secretion of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6, were normal in the myeloid cells and total PBMCs of P1 (Fig.2gand Extended Data Fig.3d). For the healthy controls, TNF production was highest in monocytes, with various lymphocyte subsets producing only small amounts of TNF after exposure to BCG. Lymphocytes from both patients displayed a complete abolition of TNF production but conserved expression of the TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1/2; Extended Data Fig.3e,f). Both the myeloid and lymphoid subsets of both patients displayed complete TNF deficiency but conserved TNFR1 and TNFR2 expression.

*** Some patients on TNF blockade develop neutropenia during treatment34. We therefore analysed the effect of TNF deficiency on leukocyte development. Complete blood-cell counts at various ages were normal for P1 and P2 (Extended Data Table4). We used spectral flow cytometry to investigate the various PBMC subsets of P1 and P2 after complete remission of TB had been achieved (Extended Data Fig.4). Both patients had similar proportions of total CD4+and CD8+T cells, and similar proportions of the naive, central memory and effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) subsets to healthy controls matched for ethnicity and age (Extended Data Fig.4a). Their proportions of effector memory CD4+cells were high, whereas the proportions of naive CD8+cells, regulatory T cells, and double-negative and double-positive T cells were within the normal range (Extended Data Fig.4a,b). The proportions of T helper cell subsets were normal (TH1, TH2) or high (TH17, TH1*) in both patients (Extended Data Fig.4c). The frequencies of γδ T cells, Vδ1+γδ T cells and Vδ2+γδ T cells were unaffected by TNF deficiency, whereas the frequencies of mucosal-associated invariant T cells were high (Extended Data Fig.4d,e). The frequencies of type 2 innate lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cell precursors were low, as was the proportion of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells (Extended Data Fig.4f–h). The proportions of B cells and NK cells and their subsets were normal in the patients (Extended Data Fig.4f–h). The frequencies of conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1 cells) were low but the proportions of cDC2 cells and plasmacytoid DCs were unaffected, as were the frequencies of monocytes and their subsets (Extended Data Fig.4i,j). Overall, these data suggest that complete TNF deficiency does not alter the development of the major myeloid and lymphoid subsets in the blood.

*** The known genetic aetiologies of MSMD and TB impair the production of or response to IFNγ5. TNF is produced predominantly by myeloid cells and its production is increased by IFNγ35. We therefore investigated the effect of TNF deficiency on IFNγ immunity. Whole-blood IFNγ levels after stimulation with IL-12, IL-23 and BCG were similar to or higher than those of healthy controls (Extended Data Fig.5a). Total PBMCs stimulated with IL-1β, IL-12, IL-23 or BCG secreted large amounts of IFNγ, similar to those observed for healthy controls (Extended Data Fig.5b). P1 and P2 had normal proportions of IFNγ+, IFNγ+T-bet+CD4+and CD8+T cells, NK cells, iNKT cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, and Vγδ1+and Vγδ2+T cells after stimulation with BCG and IL-12 (Extended Data Fig.5c,d). Thus, TNF deficiency does not affect IFNγ production by lymphocytes in vitro. We next evaluated the response to IFNγ by measuring the levels of IL-23 and IL-12p70 in whole blood from P1 and P2 after stimulation with IFNγ and BCG (Extended Data Fig.5e,f). The patients’ cells secreted normal amounts of IL-23 and IL-12p70 in response to all of the stimuli tested. Moreover, the production of IL-12p70 by PMBCs from P1 and P2 was normal after stimulation with BCG and BCG–IFNγ, confirming the normal global response to IFNγ in vitro (Extended Data Fig.5g). The production of, and response to, IFNγ were therefore normal in blood leukocytes from both of the patients with TNF deficiency.

*** We determined the molecular basis of TB in patients with inherited TNF deficiency by studying PBMCs from P1 and P2 using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We also studied PBMCs from one healthy Colombian control individual, two patients with specific variants inCYBBcausing MSMD or CGD, and two previously published patients with IRF1 deficiency7. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified 17 lymphoid and 6 myeloid leukocyte subsets (Extended Data Fig.6a,b). Both patients with TNF deficiency had slightly lower counts of classical monocytes compared with the healthy adult controls (Extended Data Fig.6c). P2 also had low counts of non-classical monocytes and cDC2 cells (Extended Data Fig.6c). Pseudobulk principal component analysis for each leukocyte subset showed normal PC1 but different PC2 for plasmablasts, non-classical monocytes and cDC1 cells from the patients with TNF deficiency, as for the two IRF1-deficient patients (Extended Data Fig.6d). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified the NPM1-target gene set as the only gene set that was significantly downregulated in non-classical monocytes from P1 and P2 but not in those from the Colombian control individual, relative to the healthy adult controls. However, the same gene set was downregulated in non-classical monocytes from the two patients with IRF1 deficiency and from patients withCYBBvariants underlying CGD or MSMD, suggesting that this phenotype is not specific to TNF deficiency (Extended Data Fig.6e). The total number of inferred intercellular interactions, estimated by CellChat, remained within the normal range for all leukocyte subsets analysed (Extended Data Fig.6f). Overall, inherited TNF deficiency led to only a subtle disturbance of transcriptional profiles in non-classical monocytes at steady state in vivo, whereas other lymphoid and myeloid leukocyte subsets were spared.

*** The production of ROS by human macrophages is essential for host defence against both BCG andM. tuberculosis20. TNF signalling through TNFR1 has been reported to be important for NADPH oxidase complex activation, as it enhances the incorporation of FAD into the NADPH oxidase enzymes36. We therefore assessed ROS production in MDMs from P1 and P2. O2−production and extracellular H2O2release in response to stimulation with PMA and IFNγ were highly impaired in GM-CSF-matured MDMs from P1 and P2 (Fig.3a,b). The cells of P1 and P2 displayed similar impairments of extracellular H2O2production with serum-opsonized heat-killedM. tuberculosis(Fig.3c). Similar results were obtained when GM-CSF-matured MDMs from healthy controls were tested in the presence of infliximab (Fig.3d). These findings were specific to TNF-deficient GM-CSF-matured MDMs, as MDM generation in the presence of M-CSF and IL-4 resulted in normal ROS production (Extended Data Fig.7a–c). Western blotting of whole-cell lysates showed that all NADPH oxidase subunits were normally expressed in the patients’ phagocytes (Extended Data Fig.7d,e). No defect in ROS production was observed in neutrophils and monocytes from P1 and P2 after stimulation with PMA, suggesting that the defect was macrophage specific (Extended Data Fig.7f). GM-CSF-matured MDMs differentiated in the presence of infliximab or adalimumab produced lower levels of ROS after exposure to BCG, heat-killedM. tuberculosisor PMA after pretreatment with IFNγ (Extended Data Fig.8a–c). Mitochondrial ROS levels in response to heat-killedM. tuberculosisor PMA in GM-CSF-matured MDMs or AML cells were unaffected by infliximab treatment, suggesting a mechanism specific to the activity of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex (Extended Data Fig.8d,e).

*** TNF signals through the two transmembrane receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are both expressed on macrophages but control different signalling pathways. We investigated the possible effects of TNF on ROS production by signalling through one or both TNF receptors, by generating isogenic knockout (KO) iPS cells. iPS-cell-derived macrophages terminally matured with GM-CSF and deficient for TNF (TNFKO) or TNFR1 (TNFR1KO) displayed a similar impairment in ROS production after stimulation with PMA and heat-killedM. tuberculosis. By contrast, no such impairment was observed for cells deficient for TNFR2 (TNFR2KO), which were able to sense soluble TNF, indicating a mechanism involving TNFR1 but not TNFR2. ROS production was abolished in iPS-cell-derived macrophages deficient for gp91phox(CYBBKO) (Fig.3e–h). The priming of iPS-cell-derived macrophages with exogenous TNF rescued the defective ROS production after PMA stimulation inTNF-KO but not inTNFR1-KO orCYBB-KO cells (Fig.3i). These results suggest that TNF signalling through TNFR1 is essential for NADPH oxidase complex activation in GM-CSF-matured MDMs. In summary, our findings suggest that a lack of TNF signalling during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the presence of GM-CSF impairs ROS production by macrophages.

*** Alveolar macrophages are thought to be among the first cells to be infected byM. tuberculosisin the alveolar space, and insufficient control ofM. tuberculosisby these cells is thought to underlie TB37,38. We assessed the impact of TNF deficiency on ROS production in a macrophage type relevant to pulmonary TB infection, by generating AML cells from monocytes of healthy controls and both patients with TNF deficiency (Fig.4a,b). AML cells from P1 and P2 released much less extracellular H2O2in response to PMA or PMA plus IFNγ stimulation compared with those of healthy controls (Fig.4a,b). Treatment of AML cells from healthy control individuals with infliximab decreased the levels of both O2−and H2O2produced in response to stimulation with PMA or PMA plus IFNγ, suggesting that TNF signalling is crucial for ROS production by AML cells in vitro (Fig.4c–f). We also evaluated ROS production after treating human lung macrophages (composed of alveolar and interstitial macrophages) isolated from lung biopsy specimens with infliximab ex vivo (Fig.4g–i). As observed for AML cells and GM-CSF-matured MDMs, the treatment of lung macrophages with infliximab decreased the amount of O2−produced in response to stimulation with PMA or PMA plus IFNγ (Fig.4g,h). Extracellular H2O2levels were also lower for infliximab-treated lung macrophages that were treated with various doses of PMA or PMA plus IFNγ (Fig.4i). Together, these findings obtained with AML cells in vitro and pulmonary macrophages ex vivo suggest that TNF signalling is important for ROS production by human alveolar macrophages in vivo.

*** We next investigated whether cell-intrinsic immunity to intramacrophagicL. monocytogeneswas altered in TNF-deficient myeloid mononuclear cells. GM-CSF-matured MDMs from both patients yielded more colony-forming units (CFUs) than those of the controls, attesting to higher rates ofL. monocytogenesinfection and/or multiplication (Fig.5a). Stimulation of the patients’ cells with TNF led to a decrease in viableL.monocytogeneslevels (Fig.5a). Similar results were obtained with infliximab-treated healthy control GM-CSF-matured MDMs, which mimicked the phenotype of the patients’ cells. (Fig.5b). Thus, TNF signalling in human GM-CSF-matured MDMs is crucial for the control ofL. monocytogenesinfection and/or replication. Finally, we infected AML cells generated from healthy controls and TNF-deficient patients with liveM. tuberculosisin the presence or absence of TNF (Fig.5c). The replication ofM. tuberculosiswas similar in AML cells from patients with TNF deficiency and healthy controls but was strongly decreased by TNF stimulation (Fig.5c). These results suggest that TNF signalling is crucial for the control ofM. tuberculosisin human AML cells. RNA-seq analysis of uninfected patient and control AML cells revealed a significant downregulation of genes associated with TNF signalling in the patients’ AML cells, as expected, whereas genes associated with inflammatory responses were significantly upregulated (Fig.5d). GSEA ofM. tuberculosis-infected AML cells detected no enrichment in patients relative to the controls for any pathway (Fig.5e). However, the patients’ AML cells secreted larger amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in response toM. tuberculosis(Fig.5fand Extended Data Tables5and6). Supplementation with TNF in the context ofM. tuberculosisinfection enhanced the inflammatory response of the patients’ AML cells and increased the transcription of genes associated with T cell responses (Fig.5f,g). These results indicate that TNF deficiency does not affect the transcriptional responses of AML cells toM. tuberculosisand suggest that other non-transcriptional mechanisms, such as impaired ROS production, underlie the susceptibility toM. tuberculosisof these patients.

*** Inherited TNF deficiency is a new genetic aetiology of recurrent pulmonary TB in adults. Our findings are consistent with both the susceptibility of TNF-deficient mice toM. tuberculosis39,40and the reactivation ofM. tuberculosisfrom latency often observed in patients on TNF blockade33. Both patients with TNF deficiency presented recurrent pulmonary TB with early relapse within 1 year of the end of treatment. The first episode was probably due to primary infection, whereas the second probably corresponded to short-term reactivation from latency. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reinfection with the same or a different mycobacterial strain. The mechanism of disease probably involves the selective impairment of ROS production by alveolar macrophages in vivo, as suggested by our analysis of GM-CSF-matured MDMs and AML cells in vitro and lung macrophages ex vivo2,13. TNF deficiency does not appear to alter the constitutive expression of the NAPDH oxidase subunits in these macrophages derived in vitro, but it did reduce their priming of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex.

*** The impairment of ROS production in TNF-deficient phagocytes was narrower than that in patients with classic CGD, who display impaired ROS production in all types of phagocytes and are prone to multiple infections, including both BCG disease and TB18,41. Disruption of the respiratory burst in granulocytes and monocytes probably accounts for most infections other than BCG and TB in patients with CGD. The patients’ respiratory-burst phenotype, restricted to GM-CSF-matured macrophages (MDMs and AML cells) in vitro, was also narrower than that in patients with MSMD due to specific variants inCYBBselectively disrupting the respiratory burst in both GM-CSF- and M-CSF/IL-4-matured MDMs20, probably accounting for their clinical phenotype being restricted to TB, without BCG disease.

*** Human TNF deficiency underlying TB may have contributed to the rarity of LOFTNFvariants in the populations tested. TB has probably killed more humans than any other single pathogen and has therefore exerted strong selective pressure on the human genome42. Purging operates much more rapidly for dominant than for recessive traits, but the intensity, prevalence and persistence of TB has purged variants in TB-susceptibility genes, such asTYK2, which underlie TB only in humans with biallelic lesions42. Nevertheless, the rarity of LOF variants may also result from other factors, including but not restricted to the impact of other infections. Moreover, not all populations have been tested, and LOF variants inIFNAR1andIFNAR2, which are exceedingly rare everywhere else, are common in the Pacific and Arctic regions, respectively43,44.

*** One of the two patients had listeriosis during pregnancy. The pregnancy may itself have contributed to the development of listeriosis45, but TNF deficiency may have also had an important role, as TNF-deficient mice are susceptible toListeriaand the rates ofListeriainfection/replication were clearly high in the patients’ MDMs46,47. Moreover,Listeriais an intramacrophagic bacterium that can, albeit rarely, underlie clinical listeriosis in patients with CGD48. It is remarkable that these two patients managed to reach adulthood without experiencing any other major infectious diseases, despite living in Colombia, a country in which not only TB and listeriosis are endemic, but also various other intramacrophagic infections, including histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis and leishmaniasis49,50,51,52,53. It is possible that the strong inflammatory responses of the patients’ AML cells observed in vitro might compensate for the loss of TNF activity.

*** It is also surprising that the two patients displayed normal clinical and biological inflammatory reactions throughout their lives, even during their episodes of TB and listeriosis. They had fever, high levels of inflammatory markers and they lost weight, and one patient even had septic shock during listeriosis; all of these features have long been considered to be due to TNF54,55. The patients even had well-formed tissue granulomas in response toM. tuberculosis, in contrast to TNF-deficient mice infected withM. tuberculosisor mice on anti-TNF treatment infected with BCG40,56,57. The two adult patients did not display any of the other known phenotypes of TNF-deficient mice, such as an impairment of the IgG antibody response after immunization58,59. Perhaps even more surprising, the patients displayed no new and unexpected phenotypes, even after more than two decades of TNF deficiency. Thus, human TNF seems to be largely redundant physiologically, but essential for the maturation and function of certain human macrophages, such as alveolar GM-CSF-dependent macrophages in particular, through its role in priming the NADPH oxidase complex and, therefore, in protective immunity to airborneM. tuberculosis.

*** Both the patients and the relatives studied are alive and being followed up in Colombia. They were recruited by the Inborn Errors of Immunity group (formerly Primary Immunodeficiencies Group) in Medellín (Colombia). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients and relatives studied. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committees of the University of Antioquia (21-07-842), the Rockefeller University (JCA-0699) and INSERM (C10-07) and was performed in accordance with the local requirements of these institutions. Experiments on samples from human participants were conducted in the USA, France, Qatar and Colombia, in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the institutional review boards of the corresponding institutions. Experiments on human lung tissue samples were approved by the regional institutional review board (Comité de Protection des Personnes Île de France VIII, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). Plasma samples from unrelated healthy individuals were collected at Sidra Medicine in accordance with a study protocol approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of Sidra Medicine, Qatar. Antibody profiles from selected, age-matched blood donors of diverse nationalities and individuals representative of the Arab general population were used for comparison (NCBI Sequence Read Archive:PRJNA685111andPRJNA688708)60. Healthy volunteers for other studies were recruited in Colombia, France and the United States.

*** P1 was born in 1994. She was vaccinated with BCG vaccine strain Pasteur at birth with no documented adverse reaction. She received other vaccines in accordance with the national immunization program of Colombia, with no adverse effects. At the age of 19 years, she had a cough for a duration of one month, with fever (40 °C), pleuritic pain and unexplained weight loss. Chest X rays and CT scans revealed multiple pulmonary micronodules and a nodular lesion in the right lung. A segmental lobectomy of the right upper lobe was performed and revealed the presence of well-constituted, paucibacillary granulomas, some of which were necrotic. Immunohistochemistry detected the presence of CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and epithelioid cells with a few giant cells. Bacterial cultures of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue were positive for a strain ofM. tuberculosisthat was found to be rifampicin-susceptible on Xpert PCR analysis. QuantiFERON and TST results were positive. Complete remission was achieved after 12 months of oral treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. At 22 years of age, P1 was hospitalized at 28 weeks of pregnancy for a vaginal and urinary tract infection. She went into septic shock shortly afterwards, and an emergency caesarean section was required to extract the fetus, due to clinical chorioamnionitis. A blood culture was positive forL. monocytogenes, leading to the initiation of 7 days of antimicrobial treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. The patient was discharged 10 days after admission. Then, 5 months later, P1 was again diagnosed with pulmonary TB. Xpert PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid again confirmed infection with rifampicin-susceptibleM. tuberculosis. At the age of 22 years, P1 was diagnosed with thymic hyperplasia, leading to thoracoscopy and complete thymectomy. Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear microscopy, Xpert PCR and cultures were negative forM. tuberculosis. A histological analysis of thymus tissue revealed mature adipose tissue, abundant thymic tissue with irregular islets but preserved architecture without signs of thymic carcinoma or thymoma. At the age of 23 years, P1 experienced a spontaneous abortion of unknown cause at 14 weeks of pregnancy. At the age of 27 years, she gave birth to a daughter. P1 is currently doing well without prophylactic treatment.

*** P2 was born in 1987 and is a first cousin of P1. He received all of the recommended vaccines according to the national vaccination schedule, including the live BCG vaccine (Pasteur strain), with no adverse effects. At the age of 18 years, he presented left pulmonary TB in the left lung with pleural effusion. P2 received 6 months of HRZE antimycobacterial treatment and responded well. However, he had a relapse eight months later and had to be hospitalized again. P2 was again diagnosed with TB, with positive QuantiFERON and TST results. He responded well to antimycobacterial treatment and is currently doing well off prophylactic treatment. Neither of the patients experienced any other severe infections caused by other bacteria, parasites or viruses. None of their relatives had a history of severe infectious diseases, including TB.

*** HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268, verified by the manufacturer via STR profiling) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11885084) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). B cells from P1 and healthy controls were immortalized by infection with EBV and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11875093) supplemented with 10% FBS. HVS-T cells for P1 and healthy controls were generated withH. saimiristrain C488 for transformation or with the TERT transformation system. HVS-T cells were cultured in Panserin/RPMI 1640 (ratio 1:1) supplemented with 20% FBS,l-glutamine, gentamycin and 20 IU ml−1human rIL-2 (Roche, 11147528001). Human iPS cells were maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A34181) in knockout DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10829-018) supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10828-028), 2 mMl-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25030-024), 1% non-essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140-035), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 15140-122), 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31350-010) and 10 ng ml−1basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Peprotech, 100-18B). The cell lines were regularly tested and were found to be free of mycoplasma contamination.

*** Genomic DNA from P1, P2 and their relatives was used for WES. Exome capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon V4+UTR and SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kits (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) generating 100 base reads. We used the Genome Analysis Software Kit (GATK) (v.3.4-46) best-practice pipeline to analyse our WES data. Reads were aligned with the human reference genome GRCh38 using BWA. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools v.3.1.1 (https://picard.sourceforge.net/). The GATK base quality-score recalibrator was used to correct sequencing artifacts. The GATK HaplotypeCaller v.4.1.4.1 was used to identify variant calls. Variants were annotated using SnpEff v.4.5 (https://snpeff.sourceforge.net/). Homozygosity rates were estimated from the patients’ genomic DNA, as previously described61. Parametric multipoint linkage analysis was performed on the WES data using MERLIN v.1.1.2, assuming AR inheritance with complete penetrance and a damaging allele frequency of 1 × 10−4. Allele frequencies were estimated for 72,817 SNPs with the gnomAD v.2.1.1 American population. Markers were clustered with anr2threshold (--rsq parameter) of 0.4. The genetic variant of interest was confirmed by PCR amplification of the region surroundingTNFexons 2 and 3 from the gDNA (5′-AGCTGTTGAATGCCTGGAAGG-3′, and 5′-CTCAGCGAGTCCTTCTCACATTG-3′) followed by Sanger sequencing.

*** We searched for copy-number variants in patient samples by applying ExomeDepth62and HMZDelFinder_opt63to WES samples mapped onto the human reference genome GRCh38. For both analyses, we selected the 50 nearest neighbours based on coverage as controls. We discarded HMZDelFinder_opt low-confidence candidates with azscore of above −1.2. All of the results were checked manually by read-mapping with Alamut Visual Plus v.1.5. The results are provided in Extended Data Table3.

*** The reactivity of circulating antibodies against common pathogens in plasma samples from P1 and P2 and healthy controls was analysed by phage immunoprecipitation–sequencing (PhIP–seq) as previously described64. Pooled human plasma for IVIg (Privigen CSL Behring), human IgG-depleted serum (HPLASERGFA5ML, Molecular Innovations) and plasma samples from unrelated healthy adults were included as controls. PhIP–seq was performed with a modified version of the original VirScan phage library and data were processed as previously described60,65.

*** RecombinantE. coli-derived IFNγ (285-IF-100/CF, R&D Systems), IL-12 (10018-IL-020, R&D Systems), IL-23 (1290-IL-010, R&D Systems) and TNF (300-01A, Peprotech) were first biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (A39257, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a biotin-to-protein molar ratio of 1:12. The detection reagent contained a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human IgG (A21445, Thermo Fisher Scientific)) diluted in Rexxip F (P0004825, Gyros Protein Technologies; 1:500 dilution of the 2 mg ml−1stock to yield a final concentration of 4 mg ml−1). PBS supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20 (0.01% PBS-T) and Gyros wash buffer (P0020087, Gyros Protein Technologies) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma samples were diluted 1:100 in 0.01% PBS-T and tested with the Bioaffy 1000 CD (P0004253, Gyros Protein Technologies) and a Gyrolab xPand (P0020520, Gyros Protein Technologies).

*** The blocking activity of anti-IFNα2, anti-IFNβ and anti-IFNω autoantibodies was determined using a reporter luciferase activity. In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the Firefly luciferase gene under the control of the human ISRE promoter in the pGL4.45 backbone, and a plasmid constitutively expressingRenillaluciferase for normalization (pRL-SV40). Cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 10% healthy control or patient serum/plasma (after inactivation at 56 °C, for 20 min) were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with 100 ng ml−1IFNα2, IFNβ or IFNω at a concentration of 10 ng ml−1or 100 pg ml−1for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed for 20 min at room temperature and luciferase levels were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 assay system (E1980 Promega).

*** The pCMV3-SP-N-Myc-TNF vector was purchased from SinoBiological (HG10602-NM) and modified to remove the Myc tag sequence. Mutagenesis was performed with appropriate primers using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, 200521). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668019). For stable transfection, WT and mutantTNFsequences were inserted into the pTRIP-CMV-Puro-2A vector (Addgene, 102611). For lentivirus production, HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.2 µg pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, 8454), 0.2 µg pHXB2 (NIH-AIDS Reagent Program; 1069), 1 µg psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid 12260) and 1.6 µg pTRIP-CMV-Puro-2A in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000. After transfection for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 3 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The viral supernatant was collected 60 h later and concentrated with a Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232). Concentrated lentivirus preparations were used for transduction in the presence of 10 µg ml−1protamine sulfate (Merck, P3369).

*** Cell lines and primary cells were lysed with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Merck, 5892970001) and PhosSTOP tablets for phosphatase inhibition (Merck, 4906837001), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 20290) and 1 mM PMSF (Merck, 10837091001). Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10–20% Criterion Tris-HCl Protein Gels (Bio-Rad, 3450043) or 4–20% TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad, 4561094), and the resulting bands were transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010). Membranes were probed with antibodies directed against TNF (C terminus, Abcam ab1793; and N terminus, Aviva Systems Biology, ARP80342_P050, both 1:1,000), GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc-47724 and sc-25778 both 1:3,000), gp91phox(Santa Cruz, sc-130543, 1:300), p67phox(Merck, 07-002, 1:2,000), p47phox(Merck, 07-001, 1:5,000), p40phox(Merck, 07-503, 1:1,000), p22phox(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-130550, 1:2,000) and EROS (Atlas Antibodies, HPA045696, 1:1,250) followed by incubation with secondary HRP-coupled anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, NXA931, 1:5,000) or anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:5,000) antibodies. Images were analysed using Image Lab v.5.1 (Bio-Rad). Uncropped western blots are provided in Supplementary Fig.1.

*** Blood leukocyte subsets were phenotyped as previously described28. In brief, freshly thawed PBMCs were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L23105, 1:800 in PBS) and blocked by incubation with FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 1:25) on ice for 15 min. The cells were washed and surface stained with the following reagents on ice for 30 min: Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences, 566385, 1:5), anti-γδTCR-BUV661 (BD Biosciences, 750019, 11F2, 1:50), anti-CXCR3-BV750 (BD Biosciences, 746895, 1C6, 1:20) and anti-CCR4-BUV615 (BD Biosciences, 613000, 1G1, 1:20) antibodies.

The cells were then washed and incubated with streptavidin-PE-Cy5 (BioLegend, 405205, 1:3,000) on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed again, fixed by incubation in 1% PFA/PBS, washed again and acquired on the Aurora cytometer using SpectroFlo v.3.0 (Cytek). Subsets were manually gated using FlowJo v.10, and the results were visualized using R v.4.

*** Whole-blood samples were collected into heparin-containing collection tubes. Blood samples were diluted 1:2 in RPMI 1640 and incubated with IFNγ (Imukin, Boehringer Ingelheim), IL-12 (20 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 219-IL), IL-23 (100 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 1290-IL), liveMycobacterium bovisBCG Pasteur substrain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 or PMA (40 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, P8139) and ionomycin (10 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, I9657). The supernatants were collected after 48 h and analysed using the LEGENDplex Human Inflammation Panel 1 (BioLegend, 740809).

*** For PBMC stimulation, 2 × 105PBMCs were plated in 96-well, round-bottomed plates containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% human serum and stimulated for 48 h with 2.5 ng ml−1IL-1β (R&D Systems, 201-LB), 50 ng ml−1IL-12 (R&D Systems, 219-IL), 100 ng ml−1IL-23 (R&D Systems, 1290-IL) and 0.1 v/v% BCG. PMA and ionomycin were added for the last 24 h. The supernatants were subjected to LEGENDplex multiplex ELISA with Human Inflammation Panel 1.

*** Freshly thawed PBMCs were dispensed into a 96-well round-bottomed plate at a density of 3 × 105cells per well, in 200 μl per well lymphocyte medium. Cells were stimulated with live BCG at an MOI of 1, IL-12 (5 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 219-IL) or IL-23 (100 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 1290-IL). After 40 h of stimulation, GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, 555029, 1:1,000) was added. The supernatants were collected after 8 h and evaluated with LEGENDplex Human Inflammation Panel 1. Cells were stained by incubation with Zombie NIR dye (BioLegend, 1:2,000) at room temperature for 15 min, and were then incubated on ice for 30 min with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-059-901, 1:50), 5-OP-RU-loaded MR1 tetramer-BV421 (NIH Tetramer Core Facility, 1:200), anti-CD3-V450 (BD Biosciences, 560365, UCHT1, 1:450), anti-CD4-BUV563 (BD Biosciences, 612912, SK3, 1:450), anti-CD8-BUV737 (BD Biosciences, 612754, SK1, 1:450), anti-CD20-BV785 (BioLegend, 302356, 2H7, 1:150), anti-CD56-BV605 (BioLegend, 362538, 5.1H11, 1:50), anti-γδTCR-Alexa Fluor 647 (BioLegend, 331214, B1, 1:50), anti-Vδ1-FITC (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-118-362, REA173, 1:150), anti-Vδ2-APC-Fire 750 (BioLegend, 331420, B6, 1:1350), anti-Vα7.2-Alexa Fluor 700 (BioLegend, 351728, 3C10, 1:50), anti-iNKT-BV480 (BD Biosciences, 746788, 6B11, 1:50) and anti-Vβ11-APC (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-125-529, REA559, 1:150) antibodies. Cells were fixed by incubation with 2% PFA/PBS on ice for 15 min, and were then permeabilized/stained by incubation overnight at −20 °C in the perm buffer from the True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BioLegend, 424401) with an intracellular cytokine panel: FcR blocking reagent, anti-IFNγ-BV711 (BioLegend, 502540, 4S.B3, 1:450), anti-TNF-BV510 (BioLegend, 502950, MAb11, 1:150), anti-IL-17A-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BioLegend, 512314, BL168, 1:1350), anti-T-bet-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 644823, 4B10, 1:1350) and anti-RORγT-PE (BD Biosciences, 563081, Q21-559, 1:50) antibodies. Cells were acquired on the Aurora cytometer (Cytek). Data were manually gated using FlowJo as previously described10,27and then imported into R for further analysis. Cellular composition was visualized with uniform manifold approximation and projection based on the expression levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56, γδTCR, Vδ1, Vδ2, Vα7.2, MR1, T-bet and RORγT, with the data downsampled to 10,000 cells per sample.

*** Cryopreserved PBMCs from P1 and P2, one Colombian adult control individual and two patients with CYBB deficiency (one with MSMD and one with CGD) were analysed using scRNA-seq as previously described24. Thawed cells were washed with medium and filtered with a 70-µm-mesh MACS SmartStrainer (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-098-462). Cells were then washed three times with PBS plus 0.5% FBS and were finally filtered again with a 40 µm cell strainer (Corning, 352340) before capture on the 10x Genomics Chromium chip. Libraries were prepared with the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit (v3 Chemistry) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (S1 flowcell). Sequences were preprocessed with CellRanger v.6 on the 10x Genomics Cloud Analysis platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/cloud-analysis). Approximately 11,000 to 16,000 cells were captured per sample, with a mean of at least 24,000 reads per cell.

*** The data generated in this study were analysed together with historical controls from the laboratory, two previously reported adult controls and two patients with IRF1 deficiency7, and publicly available control PBMC datasets downloaded from the 10x Genomics web portal (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets). Manually curated datasets were integrated with Harmony (v.3.8)66. Two runs of sequential graph-based clustering were performed. The second-round clustering focused on memory and effector T and NK cells to achieve cellular subset separation at the highest possible resolution. Clusters were manually identified with the aid of the SingleR v.2.60 pipeline67guided by MonacoImmuneData68. The TotalSeq datasets from 10x were also used to determine the identity of each cluster. Principal component analysis was conducted on count data normalized through variance-stabilizing transformation (VST). Pseudobulk differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 (v.1.40.2)69, excluding all public datasets. GSEA was conducted with the fgsea package v.1.30.0 by projecting the fold-change ranking onto the following MSigDB genesets (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/): H (Hallmark), C2 CP (Curated canonical pathways), C3 (Regulatory targets) and C5 (Gene ontologies). Intercellular communication analysis was performed using CellChat (v.1.5)70. All analyses were performed in R v.4 (http://www.R-project.org/)71.

*** CD14+cells were isolated from PBMCs with CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-050-201). GM-CSF-matured MDMs were generated with M1-Macrophage Generation Medium XF (PromoCell, C-28055). For the generation of MDMs in the presence of M-CSF + IL-4, CD14+cells were incubated for 7 days in RPMI + 10% FCS supplemented with M-CSF (R&D Systems, 216-MC), and were then allowed to differentiate in the presence of M-CSF + IL-4 (R&D Systems, 204-IL). The medium was replaced every 2 to 3 days.

*** Lung tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection for suspected lung carcinoma without previous chemotherapy (n= 5), chronic aspergillosis in a context of bronchiectasis (n= 1) or explantation in the context of chronic respiratory insufficiency in a context of pulmonary amyloidosis (n= 1). A lung sample taken from a healthy area and considered to be surgical waste was dissected free of the pleura, visible airways and blood vessels72.

*** Lung macrophages were isolated using the adhesion method73. Fluid collected from the washing of minced peripheral lung tissues was centrifuged (2,000 rpm for 10 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% FCS, 2 mMl-glutamine and antibiotics. The resuspended viable cells were then dispensed into 96-well plates. The plates were incubated for at least 1.5 h at 37 °C and non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing. The adherent cells (approximately 3 × 104cells per well) were >95% pure macrophages, as determined by May–Grünwald–Giemsa staining and CD68 immunocytochemistry. The day after isolation, macrophages were washed twice, and 100 µl RPMI medium supplemented with 1% FBS was added to each well.

*** Monocytes were isolated from patients or healthy, unrelated controls and were differentiated into AML cells as previously described2,13,74. Monocytes were isolated from PBMCs using a classical monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-117-337) and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% human serum (H4522, Merck), 80 µg ml−1poractant alfa (Curosurf, Chiesi) or 100 µg ml−1Infasurf (ONY Biotec), 10 ng ml−1GM-CSF (BioLegend, 572914), 5 ng ml−1TGF-β (BioLegend, 781804) and 5 ng ml−1IL-10 (BD, 554611) for 6 days. The surfactant and cytokines were replenished every other day.

*** ROS production by neutrophils and monocytes was analysed by subjecting whole blood to red-blood-cell lysis and then incubating the lysate with dihydrorhodamine 123 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D23806) in the presence or absence of PMA (400 ng ml−1). Monocytes were labelled with a CD14 Pacific-Blue-conjugated antibody (BD, M5E2, 558121, 1:50). The analysis was performed on the LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (BD). Superoxide production by MDMs, AMLs, lung macrophages and EBV-B cells was evaluated using the Superoxide Anion Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, CS1000) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 3 × 104MDMs, AML cells or lung macrophages, or 1 × 105EBV-B cells per well were plated in a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase and stimulated with PMA (400 ng ml−1) or serum-opsonized heat-killedM. tuberculosis(InvivoGen, tlrl-hkmt-1). Luminescence was recorded on the Victor X4 plate reader. H2O2production by MDMs, AML cells, lung macrophages and EBV-B cells was assessed using Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A22188) in Krebs–Ringer phosphate buffer. In brief, 3 × 104cells per well were plated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates, stimulated for 24 h with 100 IU ml−1IFNγ or 20 ng ml−1TNF (R&D Systems, 210-TA). H2O2release was measured after stimulation with PMA or serum-opsonized heat-killedM. tuberculosison the Victor X4 (Perkin Elmer) plate reader.

*** Superoxide production by mitochondria was analysed using confocal microscopy with the MitoSOX Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M36008). We plated 4 × 105cells GM-CSF-matured MDMs and AML cells from healthy controls on coverslips (80826, iBidi) and treated them with infliximab (5 µg ml−1) or isotype control (5 µg ml−1) for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with PMA (400 ng ml−1), 0.5% DMSO or heat-killedM. tuberculosis(330 µg ml−1) for 4 h and were then incubated with 800 nM MitoSOX and 150 nM MitoTracker Green FM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M7514) in HBSS buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with HBSS and stained by incubation for 5 min with 1 µg ml−1Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 62249). Specific fluorescence was acquired with a Leica TCS SP8 STED (Leica) confocal laser-scanning microscope (×63 oil immersion lens).

*** iPS cell KO lines were generated by the Stem Cell Research facility at MSKCC. CRISPR sgRNAs targeting the gene of interest were designed using the algorithm available online (https://www.benchling.com/crispr/). The target sequences were inserted into the pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 vector (Addgene, 42230) for the generation of specific gene-targeting constructs. Variants were introduced into the parental C12 iPS cell line by electroporating single-iPS-cell suspensions (1 × 106cells per reaction) with 4 µg sgRNA-construct plasmid in Nucleofector human stem cell solution (Lonza, VPH-5012). The electroporated cells were cultured for 4 days in feeder-cell-free conditions and were then passaged at low density to obtain single-cell colonies. Individual colonies were picked 10 days later, expanded and analysed using PCR. The lines obtained were karyotyped to check for the absence of chromosomal abnormalities.

*** We differentiated macrophages from human iPS cells as previously described75,76. In brief, iPS cells were maintained for three days in iPS cell medium (with 10 ng ml−1bFGF) and then 4 days in iPS cell medium only. On day 7, iPS cell colonies were transferred to low-adhesion plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 657185) in the presence of 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, Y0503). After 6 days of incubation, embryoid bodies were transferred to hematopoietic differentiation medium (APEL 2 medium (Stem Cell Tech, 05270) supplemented with 5% protein-free hybridoma (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12040077), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 25 ng ml−1IL-3 (Peprotech, 200-03) and 50 ng ml−1M-CSF (Peprotech, 300-25). From day 25 of differentiation onwards, cells in suspension were carefully collected, cultured for 6–10 days in RPMI medium + 10% FBS and 100 ng ml−1GM-CSF (Peprotech, 300-03).

*** GM-CSF-matured macrophages were treated for 48 h with IFNγ (103IU ml−1) and TNF (50 ng ml−1). Infliximab or isotype control (both 5 µg ml−1) was added on days 1 and 7 of macrophage differentiation. Cells were infected withL. monocytogenes(MOI of 20 for 1 h at 37 °C). They were then washed twice and incubated with gentamicin (25 µg ml−1) for 30 min, 3 h or 6 h. The cells were washed and lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS and serial dilutions were plated on BHI agar and incubated overnight.

*** M. tuberculosisstrain Erdman was used for the infection of AML cells.M. tuberculosiswas grown to exponential growth phase in 7H9 Middlebrook medium supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC), with shaking at 200 rpm. A single-cell mycobacterial suspension was prepared by washing bacteria collected by centrifugation twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80 (PBST80) and then centrifuging at 200gfor 10 min. AML cells were infected at an MOI of 5, calculated from the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the final suspension, considering an OD600of 1.0 to equate to approximately 5 × 108CFU per ml. After 4 h, the cells were washed once with RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum and cultured for up to 5 days.

*** The supernatant ofM. tuberculosis-infected AML cells was passed through a filter with 0.22 µm pores twice and was then stored at −80 °C. Cytokine levels were quantified using LEGENDplex Human Inflammation Panel 1 (BioLegend, 740809) and LEGENDplex Human Cytokine Panel 2 (BioLegend, 741378). For the isolation ofM. tuberculosisfrom infected AML cells, 0.01% Triton X-100 in sterile water was added to the wells and the plates were then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The culture was then passed up and down in a pipette to ensure AML cell lysis. Cell lysates were diluted with PBST80and cultured on 7H10 Middlebrook agar supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% OADC for 2 weeks at 37 °C. RNA was prepared by washing cell monolayers with PBS and then extracting the RNA in TRIzol.

*** We used the NovaSeq S1 platform (single-end, 100 bp reads), aiming to obtain 20–30 million reads per sample. The RNA-seq fastq raw data were inspected to ensure that they were of high quality and then mapped onto the human reference genome GRCh38 using STAR aligner (v.2.7)77. The aligned RNA-seq BAM files were used to quantify the gene-level read counts using featureCounts (v.1.6.0)78; these counts were then vst-normalized and log2-transformed using DESeq2 (v.1.40.2)69to obtain values for the expression of all genes and all samples. The data were then analysed to identify the genes differentially expressed between the patients and the controls in baseline conditions without infection and at various timepoints (days 3 and 5) after stimulation (M. tuberculosis,M. tuberculosis+ TNF). We used the fgsea package v.1.30.0 to perform GSEA for MSigDB hallmark gene sets and gene ontologies.

*** All statistical analyses were performed using R v.4 (http://www.R-project.org/) and GraphPad Prism software v.9.5.0 (GraphPad). The statistical significance of quantitative differences between groups was assessed using Mann–WhitneyU-tests or unpaired two-tailed Student’st-tests. The statistical significance of differences between treated and untreated samples from the same donor was assessed using paired two-tailed Student’st-tests.Pvalues are indicated only for statistically significant differences.
