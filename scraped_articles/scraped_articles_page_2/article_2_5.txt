*** Olfaction is a fundamental sensory modality that guides animal and human behaviour1,2. However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration.

*** Olfaction, the sense of smell, is vital for humans2. Enhancing our understanding of the underlying neuronal mechanisms is essential, considering the importance of olfaction in health and disease. Olfactory processing commences when airborne odour molecules activate olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium (Fig.1a). Axons of neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor3converge onto specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, representing odour information as a topographic map of receptor activation4. After olfactory bulb processing4, mitral and tufted cells relay information to several cortical areas that constitute the primary olfactory cortex, including the piriform cortex (PC), amygdala and entorhinal cortex (EC)5. Direct projections to the EC are established in rodents6,7but have not yet been confirmed in humans8. The PC is key for odour processing9. In contrast to the olfactory bulb, there is no apparent topography representing odour quality or identity in the PC1,9,10,11, raising the question of how odour-specific information is organized within the human PC. While human imaging12,13and intracranial electroencephalography14studies showed odour-related PC activation at the macroscopic level, recordings in rodents demonstrated odour-related responses of individual PC neurons10,15,16,17,18, and provided a deeper understanding of odour identity and intensity coding in the PC19,20,21. Besides the PC, multiple medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions contribute to central olfactory processing. In animal models, neurons responsive to odours have been identified in the amygdala, EC and hippocampus22,23. Human imaging studies have complemented these findings by demonstrating odour-related activation in these regions (amygdala13,24, EC13,24and hippocampus25).

*** Human single-unit recordings have substantially advanced our conceptual understanding in various areas of neuroscience such as auditory processing26, object representation27and memory formation28. However, such studies are lacking in olfaction. In humans, it remains unclear whether and how individual neurons respond to olfactory cues and encode odour identity. We therefore investigated the individual contributions of central olfactory areas to odour processing and their link to human behaviour at the neuronal level. We took advantage of the rare opportunity to record individual neuron activity in the human PC and MTL during an odour rating and identification task. Such single-unit recordings offer unique insights that bridge the long-standing gap between animal electrophysiology and human imaging studies in olfactory research. We identified odour-modulated neurons that effectively encode odour identity. We further demonstrate a distinct role of the amygdala in emotional processing of odours and highlight hippocampal involvement in odour identification. Notably, not only do our recordings reveal that PC neurons are able to encode the identity of odour-related images, but they also demonstrate cross-modal integration of visual and olfactory information in both the PC and amygdala.

*** Although single-neuron recordings in animal models have greatly advanced our understanding of olfaction, concepts of single-neuron and circuit function in human olfactory processing are largely unexplored. To bridge this knowledge gap, we recorded the activity of single neurons in the human PC and MTL while patients smelled different odours. Overall, we recorded human single-neuron activity (2,416 neurons across 27 sessions) during odour rating and identification tasks in 17 patients undergoing presurgical epilepsy monitoring (Fig.1b,cand Extended Data Fig.1). Respiratory measurements confirmed alignment of inhalation with odour presentation (Fig.1d). Patients reported to have liked the odours in 64.8 ± 2.0% of cases (Fig.1e,f(left)) and they correctly identified them in 74.1 ± 1.5% of trials (Fig.1e,f(right); the performance per participant is shown in Extended Data Fig.2).

*** First, we investigated whether neuronal firing in the human PC encodes chemical odour identity. Figure1gshows an example neuron in the left PC that increased firing in response to specific odours. We refer to these neurons, which significantly change their firing based on odour identities, as odour-modulated neurons (further examples are shown in Extended Data Fig.3). Overall, approximately 40% of PC neurons showed odour-modulated response patterns, emphasizing the role of the PC in odour processing (Fig.1h). We next examined whether odour-modulated neurons also exist in the human MTL. Whereas early, pioneering multiunit recordings in humans did not provide evidence for odour-specific neurons in the human amygdala29, we identified a substantial fraction of amygdala neurons exhibiting odour-modulated firing (Fig.1h). Moreover, we observed a significant set of odour-modulated neurons in the EC and hippocampus (Fig.1h). Odour-modulated neurons were reliably identified across the participants (Extended Data Fig.4a). Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) (Fig.1j) demonstrate prominent peaks in firing rate after odour onset among odour-modulated neurons in the PC, amygdala, EC and hippocampus, whereas no such increase was observed in the parahippocampal cortex (PHC).

*** Sniffing odourless air alone has been shown to activate the PC in animal models30and in human imaging studies31,32. To disentangle putatively mechanosensitive and breathing-related effects from actual chemosensory responses, we included an odourless control. Exposure to odourless controls alone increased firing of odour-modulated neurons, albeit to a significantly lower degree than in response to odours (Fig.1i). Such differences were most prominent in the PC, but also statistically significant in the amygdala, EC and hippocampus (Fig.1i). Increased firing rates for odours compared to odourless controls were consistently observed when accounting for participants and sessions (Extended Data Table1a). Odour-modulated neurons were likewise identified after excluding the odourless control (Extended Data Fig.4b,c). Respiratory measurements confirmed that odour-modulated neurons were driven by odour-specific characteristics rather than by variability in respiration (Extended Data Fig.5). Together, our findings firmly establish the existence of odour-modulated neurons both in the human PC and MTL.

*** The lack of human single-neuron recordings during olfactory processing has thus far hindered studying the underlying neuronal population codes at high spatial (that is, cellular) and temporal resolution. We therefore assessed how effectively odour identity is represented by neurons in different regions, performing decoding analysis on spiking data33(Fig.2a). Odour identity was predicted from neuronal spiking with high degrees of accuracy in the PC, amygdala, EC and hippocampus (Fig.2b). Subsampling equal numbers of neurons per region demonstrated the highest decoding performance in the PC, followed by the amygdala and EC (Fig.2b). Increasing the number of neurons included in decoding further improved performance (Fig.2c). Notably, odour identity was reliably decoded by only a small number of neurons, especially in the PC. When systematically varying the decoding time window, odour-identity decoding was fastest in the PC and amygdala. By contrast, approximately a 1 s time window was required to reach above-chance decoding accuracy in the EC and hippocampus (Fig.2d). Significant odour-identity decoding was observed across the recording sessions (Fig.2e) and participants (Extended Data Fig.6a). In conclusion, our results demonstrate effective neuronal odour-identity coding in humans across multiple brain regions involved in odour processing.

Each red dot shows the decoding performance based on 200 randomly drawn neurons (1,000 subsampling runs). The decoding performance (mean ± s.e.m.) across subsampling runs is shown in black. The grey dots indicate the decoding performance on label-permuted data. The chance level (6.25%) is indicated by the dashed horizontal line. Significance was calculated based on the percentile of mean decoding performance of the real data within the surrogate distribution (PC,P< 0.001; amygdala,P< 0.001; EC,P< 0.001; hippocampus,P< 0.001; PHC,P= 0.16; label permutation test withn= 1,000 permutations). s.e.m. margins inb–dare barely visible.c, Odour-identity decoding (mean ± s.e.m.) as a function of the number of neurons included (100 subsampling runs).

Despite the limited and variable neuron counts per session, odour identity could be decoded significantly above chance (6.25%, dashed line) in the PC, amygdala, EC and hippocampus (PC, 14 out ofn= 17 sessions showed significant decoding compared to 1,000 odour-label-permuted data,P< 10−10; amygdala, 13 out ofn= 27,P= 1.3 × 10−10; EC, 5 out ofn= 21,P= 0.0032; hippocampus, 6 out ofn= 27,P= 0.0019; PHC, 1 out ofn= 24,P= 0.71; right-sided binomial test,Pchance= 0.05, regions with ≥2 neurons). Diagrams were created using BioRender (a) and Noun Project (a).

*** We next addressed the sparseness of the human olfactory code. To this end, we compared odour representations across regions based on their population sparseness index34. Sparseness differed significantly across regions (Fig.3a). As extracellular recordings tend to omit very sparse neurons in the spike sorting35, absolute sparseness values are challenging to interpret. Nonetheless, we can compare sparseness across regions given that the same recording and spike-sorting techniques were used. The amygdala and hippocampus showed the sparsest odour coding (Fig.3a). The population code in the PC was significantly less sparse than that in the MTL areas. Consistent results were obtained when analysing population sparseness separately for each recording session (Extended Data Fig.7a). Our findings indicate that the degree of sparseness varies significantly along the human olfactory pathway, with the amygdala and hippocampus showing the highest degree of sparseness.

*** a, The population sparseness index for each of the 15 odours across regions containing odour-modulated neurons (odours are colour coded as in Fig.1; mean ± s.e.m. (black)). The sparseness of odour coding significantly differed across regions (one-way ANOVA,F3,56= 505,P< 10−10). PC exhibited a less sparse odour code than MTL regions (P< 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons, except for amygdala versus hippocampus, for whichP= 0.47, after applying Tukey’s honestly significant difference procedure).b, The average response strength (mean ± s.e.m.) of odour-modulated neurons for repeated odour presentations across regions containing odour-modulated neurons. Insets: the response slopes per region (mean ± s.e.m.). Significance was calculated based on a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test against a constant response strength, that is, a slope of zero (PC,n= 99 neurons,Z= −3.4,P= 0.00081; amygdala,n= 130,Z= −4.5,P= 6.9 × 10−6; EC,n= 74,Z= −1.7,P= 0.087; hippocampus,n= 74,Z= −2.4,P= 0.019). Firing of PC neurons substantially decreased from the first to the second odour presentation (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing firing rates of the first versus second trial in PC:n= 99 neurons,Z= 4.9,P= 8.6 × 10−7; Extended Data Fig.7e). NS, not significant.

*** We also investigated whether and how repeated presentations of the same odour affect responses of odour-modulated neurons. During our paradigm, each odour was presented eight times in a pseudorandom order with an average interpresentation interval for the same odour of approximately 5 min (5.18 ± 0.05 min). Despite this substantial interval, we observed decreasing response activity after repeated presentations in the PC, amygdala and hippocampus (Fig.3b). This effect was not caused by decreased inhalation (Extended Data Fig.7b,c). Odour-modulated neurons in the EC showed a decreasing trend that did not reach significance. Repetition suppression was reliably found when factoring in individual participants and sessions (Extended Data Table1b). Repetition suppression was also observed when, instead of including only odour-modulated neurons, all recorded neurons were considered (Extended Data Fig.7d). Notably, the response strength reduction in the PC showed a substantial first-trial effect (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.7e). Together, our analyses reveal differences in sparseness across central odour-processing areas, in conjunction with central repetition suppression.

*** The central role of the amygdala in emotional processing is well established36,37, and rodent studies have revealed valence coding in amygdala neurons38. However, animals cannot directly report subjective preferences, and odour-valence coding remains unclear at the individual-neuron level in humans. Consequently, we investigated whether amygdala neurons encode subjective odour preferences and valence. On the basis of individual odour ratings, we compared neuronal responses of odour-modulated neurons to odours rated as liked versus disliked (Fig.4a). Figure4b,cshows an example amygdala neuron that responded preferentially to liked odours. Overall, the responses of odour-modulated neurons in the amygdala were significantly greater for liked versus disliked odours (Fig.4d). No significant difference was observed in other regions. Increased activity of odour-modulated neurons in the amygdala in response to liked odours was also evident when correcting for session and participant-specific differences (Extended Data Table1c). Using published valence ratings39of the standardized odours used in our study, we sought to correlate general valence ratings with the activity of odour-modulated neurons in the amygdala. Here we found a significant correlation of firing rate with valence across recordings (Fig.4e).

Theyaxis displays 99% of data. Diagrams were created using BioRender (aandf) and Noun Project (aandf).

*** Successful odour identification requires odour perception, recognition and recall of the semantic odour label. The MTL has been suggested to have an essential role in these processes40, although the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Thus, we next investigated whether single-neuron activity is linked to behavioural odour identification performance (Fig.4f). We found that correct odour identification is accompanied by an overall increase in the firing rate of odour-modulated neurons (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank,n= 406,Z= 2.36,P= 0.018). We next investigated whether neuronal odour representations relate to behavioural identification performance. We correlated odour-decoding accuracy in each recording session and region with behavioural odour-identification performance and found a significant positive correlation exclusively in the hippocampus (Fig.4g). This correlation was consistently observed across the participants (Extended Data Fig.6b). Moreover, odour identification performance at the behavioural level was correlated with higher proportions of odour-modulated neurons in the hippocampus and EC (Extended Data Fig.6c). We next analysed whether neuronal odour representations reflected chemical odour identity (presented odours) rather than subjective perception (selected odour labels). Decoding revealed a dissociation between PC and hippocampus, with PC neurons coding preferably for chemical odour identity, and hippocampal neurons predicting perceived odour identity (Fig.4h). Collectively, our findings reveal distinct roles of amygdala neurons in odour-valence coding and hippocampal neurons in odour identification.

*** Natural environments require humans and other species to constantly integrate visual and olfactory sensory cues. How visual and olfactory information is integrated at the level of individual neurons is still unexplored in humans. We recorded from neurons along the human olfactory pathway to explore representations of congruent visual and olfactory stimuli (Fig.5a). For this purpose, the participants completed an additional visual task after our olfactory paradigm (20 out of 27 sessions), during which they repeatedly viewed images of objects, each of which corresponded to one of the odours in our panel (for example, orange odour and image of an orange). This enabled us to compare neuronal activity after exposure to congruent images and odours within the same population of neurons. Image-modulated neurons (Fig.5b) were identified analogously to odour-modulated neurons. Across regions, we found more neurons modulated by odours than by images, with a significant overlap between both populations (Fig.5c). Specifically, significantly more PC and amygdala neurons were odour modulated than image modulated, signifying their central role in odour processing. Nonetheless, a significant fraction of PC neurons was image modulated (35 neurons out of 277,P= 5.7 × 10−7, two-sided binomial test,n= 277 neurons,Pchance= 0.05), that is, they changed firing based on the image identity (Fig.5b). The ability of PC neurons to encode odour-related image identity was further confirmed by decoding analysis (Fig.5dand Extended Data Fig.6d). Notably, neuronal activity in the PC predicted odour-related image identity more accurately than in any of the MTL regions, demonstrating that human PC neurons are not exclusively driven by olfaction, but also encode information from other sensory modalities. To determine whether there is a unified code for olfactory and visual stimuli, we trained a decoder on odours and tested its performance on images, and vice versa. The results showed that neuronal coding in the amygdala and PC generalizes across odours and images, suggesting cross-sensory representations in these regions (Fig.5e,fand Extended Data Fig.6e,f). Notably, in this analysis, identity decoding in the PC only generalized when training on odours and testing on images, and not vice versa, whereas the amygdala exhibited cross-modal coding in both cases.

*** In the human MTL, concept cells have been identified that respond with a high degree of invariance to representations of a specific concept (for example, a picture as well as the written and spoken name of a person or an object)41,42. In our recordings, we identified neurons exhibiting concept cell-like characteristics. For example, a neuron in the amygdala increased firing selectively in response to the image of a banana (Fig.5g). Notably, the same neuron also responded to the odour of banana and the written word ‘banana’, indicating semantic coding in the olfactory domain. Moreover, we recorded a PC neuron selectively responding to liquorice odour, the image of liquorice and the written word ‘liquorice’ (Fig.5h). Notably, this neuron also responded to a second odour, anise, an odour that is typically associated with and contained in liquorice candy. These observations in the amygdala and PC suggest semantic representations of odours at early stages of olfactory processing. Collectively, our findings reveal encoding of odour-related visual information in human PC neurons, as well as multimodal odour representations in the human amygdala and PC.

*** Despite the importance of human olfaction in health and disease, our understanding of central odour coding relies primarily on animal models and human imaging studies. Although highly informative at the macroscopic level, functional human brain imaging lacks both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to investigate the individual neuron and circuit coding logic underlying human olfactory processing. We are therefore facing a considerable knowledge gap in human olfactory research. Here we recorded from human single neurons in PC and MTL, providing insights into olfactory processing. Across both primary and secondary olfactory areas, we identified neurons that responded to odours and altered their firing based on odour identity. We observed suppressed response strength after repeated odour presentations at prolonged intervals beyond peripheral sensory adaptation. Analysis of population sparseness revealed a more distributed code in PC compared to MTL regions. Nonetheless, neuronal activity in both the PC and MTL could accurately decode odour identity. Our findings suggest that different MTL regions mediate distinct aspects of odour processing. Amygdala neurons encode odour valence, whereas hippocampal activity predicts odour identification performance. Notably, we show that human PC neurons efficiently encode odour-related image identity. Integrating data from both odour-related visual and olfactory stimuli, we identified neurons with the ability to represent a specific stimulus concept (for example, banana) in a cross-modal manner by responding to the scent, an image and the written name of a banana. The PC and amygdala in particular engage in cross-modal coding.

*** Given its central role in odour processing and the distributed non-chemotopic olfactory coding in the PC proposed by animal studies10,11,17,19,20, we hypothesized a corresponding coding logic implemented by human PC neurons. We have demonstrated that a substantial fraction of PC neurons is modulated by odour identity. Moreover, activity in few PC neurons is sufficient to accurately decode chemical odour identity. The PC exhibits a more distributed odour code compared with MTL regions, indicating an increase in sparseness of odour representations along the human olfactory pathway. Tuning profiles of PC neurons appear relatively broad as odour-modulated neurons frequently responded to several odours. Thus, similar to results from animal studies19,20, the labelled-line organization of chemotopic information established in the human olfactory bulb is disrupted along the bulb-to-PC signalling axis.

*** Beyond the PC, we identified odour-modulated neurons in various MTL regions, including the amygdala, EC and hippocampus. Effective coding of odour information within these regions highlights their importance for central odour processing and formation of odour representations. Notably, decoding power decreased (and required both larger ensembles and longer integration periods) along the hierarchy of the olfactory processing pathway. Neural representations of odours emerged first in the PC and amygdala and only approximately 500 ms later in the EC. This delay in EC odour coding could support a connectivity scheme in which, in contrast to rodents6,7, human olfactory bulb mitral cells might not directly project to the EC. Together, our findings resolve the long-standing question of whether and how individual neurons in human PC and MTL respond to odours29, setting the stage for future studies to decipher the human olfactory code.

*** We are constantly surrounded by a variety of odours. Thus, detecting novel odours is of high behavioural relevance—for example, to identify potential hazards like smoke. We observed a decrement in response strength with repeated presentations (approximately every 5 min) of the same odour in the PC, amygdala and hippocampus. This temporal regime exceeds typical timescales consistent with olfactory sensory neuron adaptation43, thereby favouring the interpretation that central habituation mechanisms are responsible for the observed response reduction. While olfactory habituation has been reported both in animals44and at macroscopic scale in human imaging studies13,45, we demonstrate this phenomenon in humans at the single-neuron level. Notably, the response reduction in odour-modulated neurons qualitatively resembles that of visual responses in the human MTL46. The pronounced suppression observed in PC neurons between first and second stimulation is particularly marked. This may indicate high responsiveness of PC neurons to novel odours, consistent with the ‘first-trial effect’ observed in zebrafish47, and could result from local inhibitory circuits specific to the PC48. The absence of a first-trial effect in other downstream regions indicates that olfactory information is processed in parallel and not merely relayed through the PC. The apparent lack of habituation at the earliest stages of human olfactory processing—the olfactory epithelium43and olfactory bulb49—furthermore suggests that the first-trial effect emerges predominantly at the PC level.

*** On the basis of individual hedonic ratings, we demonstrated that odour-modulated amygdala neurons change firing depending on personal preferences and that amygdala firing correlates with reference odour-valence values39. Human imaging studies have demonstrated amygdala activation by odours both with positive and negative valence37,50. However, their effects are not easily differentiated using univariate bulk-tissue-imaging methods36, indicating local effects of odour-valence encoding51. Our single-neuron data suggest that odour-modulated neurons in the amygdala are involved in integrating odour identity and valence information. As positive valence was predominant in our study, future research should encompass odours that span the entire valence dimension to conclude whether our findings generalize. As both odour intensity and valence have been shown to influence the response of the human amygdala37,51,52, future studies should also systematically vary odour intensity to investigate the interplay of valence and intensity coding. For this purpose, high-end olfactometers allowing for precise odour control will be essential.

*** Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease often first manifest with olfactory deficits, particularly concerning odour identification53. Our results link odour representations of hippocampal neurons directly with behavioural odour-identification performance, indicating that hippocampal degeneration may contribute to odour-identification deficits. Impaired behavioural odour identification performance could be a direct result of local neurodegeneration or could instead result indirectly from degeneration of upstream circuits (for example, olfactory bulb). Future research will have to explore causal contributions of odour-modulated neurons in odour identification.

*** The PC is generally regarded as a primary olfactory area. However, with its three-layered architecture and immensely plastic recurrent connectivity, it resembles the structure of an association cortex48,54. Recent rodent studies have shown that neurons in the posterior PC precisely encode spatial information, suggesting a role in odour–place association15. Further evidence for multimodal processing of odour-related information in the PC stems from rodents55and human imaging studies56,57. Here we tested semantically coherent olfactory and visual stimuli to explore coding of PC neurons beyond olfactory perception. We identified that PC neurons decode not only odours, but also odour-related image identities. Thus, the PC not only processes olfactory stimuli, but also integrates top-down semantic information from higher cognitive areas. Notably, odour-related images were decoded more accurately in the PC than in the MTL. Future research will need to examine whether PC neurons specifically encode odour-related images, or whether they also process images of odourless objects. Our results further suggest PC involvement in multimodal, possibly even semantic integration. The lack of a specific odour-imagination task prevents us from delineating whether these multimodal representations are correlates of cross-modal integration or olfactory imagery58. While there is an ongoing debate how olfaction differs from other human senses, particularly with regard to olfactory imagery and the role of verbal descriptors59,60, our findings suggest that conceptual neuronal coding schemes of olfactory information resemble those of other senses42. Assigning semantic odour labels is a uniquely human ability. Here we revealed that PC neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, whereas hippocampal activity rather reflects subjectively perceived odours. This integrates well with our finding that hippocampal activity predicts behavioural odour identification, indicating that coherent internal and external odour representations facilitate semantic odour identification. While invariant responses of MTL concept neurons to visual (pictures or written text) and auditory (spoken words) stimuli have been described previously42, chemosensory concept cells have not been identified to date. We observed neurons that generalize their response to congruent visual and olfactory stimuli. As demonstrated by cross-modal decoding analysis, amygdala neurons in particular generalize their coding between the olfactory and visual domain. Together, our findings demonstrate concept-based neuronal coding in human olfaction.

*** Data were collected at the Department of Epileptology at the University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany. All of the patients in our study had drug-resistant epilepsy and underwent invasive seizure monitoring with the goal of subsequent neurosurgical resection of the seizure-generating focus. Overall, 27 sessions were recorded in 17 patients with epilepsy (12 female, 5 male; aged 22 to 60 years, mean ± s.d., 41.3 ± 11.7 years). Microwire bundles were implanted bilaterally to record single-neuron activity in the MTL and, in a subset of patients, also in the PC (17 sessions in 9 patients). All studies conformed with and were approved by the Medical Institutional Review Board of the University of Bonn, Germany (289/20). Each patient provided informed written consent.

*** Patients were implanted with Behnke-Fried depth electrodes (AdTech) (Extended Data Fig.1a,b). These hollow rodlike electrodes have a diameter of 1.25 mm with 8 cylindrical clinical macroelectrodes (platinum–iridium). The innermost two macro contacts are spaced 3 mm apart, while the remaining contacts are equidistantly spaced. Through each electrode, a bundle of platinum–iridium microwires with a diameter of 40 µm was inserted. Each bundle contained eight insulated high-impedance (typically 200–500 kΩ)61recording wires and one low-impedance reference wire without insulation. Electrodes were implanted using a rigid stereotactic frame (Leksell, Elekta) with an orthogonal guide tube62. Electrode target locations were determined by clinical criteria and differed minimally within target regions across patients. This, along with the technical limitation of precisely localizing microwire positions, precluded us from targeting specific subregions, for example, individual subnuclei of the amygdala or specific hippocampal subfields. Electrode placement was controlled by intraoperative CT scans co-registering the head-fixed frame to pre-operative MRI planning scans. After skin incision at the electrode entry point, a hole for an anchor bolt was drilled, and the anchor bolt was screwed into the skull using the guide tube. Microwire bundles were preloaded into the macroelectrodes and trimmed by a single cut with either a scalpel or surgical scissors on a back table in the operation room, such that they protruded from the tip of the clinical electrode by 3 to 5 mm. Extended Data Fig.1cdisplays SEM images of uncut and cut microwires for comparison. After preparation, microwire bundles were replaced by a guiding rod for implantation. After the insertion of the macroelectrode into its target position, the guiding rod was retracted and the microwire bundle was carefully inserted to avoid kinking or bending62. Local field potentials containing single-neuron activity were sampled at 32,768 Hz, band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 9,000 Hz, and amplified by a 256-channel ATLAS amplifier (Neuralynx) using Pegasus (v.2.1.1, Neuralynx). Spike extraction and sorting were performed using Combinato63. Spikes of negative voltage deflection were extracted and analysed. For illustration, spikes are depicted with inverted polarity. Automated artifact removal based on the DER algorithm64was applied to all sessions. Clustering of each channel was manually validated by an experienced rater, and artifacts were removed. As Combinato (used with the default parameters in this study) tends to overcluster the recorded unit data in automated mode, we manually merged clusters on the basis of their waveforms, cross correlograms and other firing characteristics. Single-unit recording quality and spike sorting was validated based on inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations, spike amplitudes and spike peak signal-to-noise (SNR), as well as cluster isolation distance (Extended Data Fig.8). Electrode localization was performed based on co-registered CTs and MRIs using the LeGUI software package (v.1.2)65and electrode locations were visualized using Fieldtrip (v.213bc8bcb)66and the ‘plot_ecog’ function (https://github.com/s-michelmann/moment-by-moment-tracking/blob/master/plot_ecog.m). A total of 2,416 units was recorded (1,292 single units (SU)): 622 units (348 SU) in the amygdala, 464 units (256 SU) in the EC, 634 units (341 SU) in the hippocampus, 419 units (199 SU) in the PHC and 277 units (148 SU) in the PC.

*** As odour stimuli, we used standard pen-like Sniffin’ Sticks from the Identification-16 test (Burghart Messtechnik). The participants sat in bed with a laptop on a tray in front of them while they were presented with 15 different odour stimuli, administered eight times in pseudorandom order. The pen containing leather was replaced by a blank odourless pen that served as control (26 of 27 recordings). Odour pens were presented approximately 2 cm below the nose, centred between both nostrils. The patients were verbally instructed on each trial to inhale on command (“Please inhale NOW!”). To ensure consistent odour sampling across trials, the participants were asked to inhale only once for each odour presentation and not sniff at their convenience. Odour pens were immediately removed after the first inhalation. This experimental protocol was devised to minimize odour-specific respiratory variability. The experimenter’s (M.S.K.) direct supervision ensured adherence to the instructions throughout the experiment. Pens were opened only immediately before odour exposure. Simultaneous with the inhale command, the presentation time was logged and an odour was administered. In 13 out of 27 recording sessions, respiration was measured using thoracic and abdominal plethysmography belts (Extended Data Fig.5a; SleepSense, Scientific Laboratory Products). Data from both belts were averaged and analysed using the Breathmetrics toolbox67(v.2.0, human respiratory belt default settings with sliding baseline correction). In the remaining 14 sessions, respiration belts could not by applied due to patient discomfort or noisy interference with the microwire recordings. Overall, the participants complied accurately with the experimental protocol, inhaling once during odour exposure and well timed to odour delivery (Fig.1dand Extended Data Fig.5c). Bilateral measurements of nasal airflow will allow future studies to precisely examine the interactions of neuronal activity and local oscillatory dynamics across the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres at a high temporal resolution. Standardized pen-like odour stimuli lack millisecond precision and exact control of odour concentrations that can be achieved with high-end olfactometers. However, this odour-delivery method proved to be both efficient and effective for presenting a wide range of odour stimuli in the clinical environment.

*** During the first four presentation cycles, the patients were asked to rate whether they liked or disliked the odour (forced choice; Fig.1e). In 64.8 ± 2.0% of trials, the participants reported to like the odour. Although liking and valence have been differentiated in some contexts68, we use the term valence as a multifaceted concept that includes liking69. In the subsequent four presentation cycles, odours were to be identified by choosing the correct odour name out of four options (Fig.1e). Written odour names (labels) were selected pseudorandomly from a list of the 15 odour stimuli plus the neutral, odourless control. Each odour label was used 4 times as the correct and 12 times as an incorrect choice option. Name options were sequentially added at 1 s intervals, allowing stimulus-specific assessment of neuronal activity to individual written odour-associated words (Fig.5g,h). To avoid confounding cueing effects induced by previous presentation of semantically matching odours, we excluded trials from the analysis in which the odour word was the correct choice option (Fig.5g,h). The participants identified the correct odour in 74.1 ± 1.5% of cases. The mean presentation time of odours was 2.31 ± 0.13 s, the mean inter-odour interval was 19.4 ± 0.4 s, with the same odours repeated on average every 5.18 ± 0.05 min. In 20 out of 27 recordings, immediately after the olfactory task, we additionally presented 16 pictures, each semantically corresponding to one of the odours, including a light grey screen to match the odourless control. Each picture was presented for 1 s, 8 times, in pseudorandom order. This protocol enabled us to identify neurons responding to images that were semantically congruent to the odours presented in this study. The experimental tasks were implemented using MATLAB R2019a (MathWorks) and Psychtoolbox370,71,72.

*** All statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB 2021a. Unless otherwise stated, nonparametric and two-sided statistical tests were applied with aPvalue below anα-level of 0.05 considered to be significant. The arithmetic mean was used to compute averages, and the error bars represent the s.e.m. or the s.d. as specified. Spearman’s rank-order correlations were used for all correlational analyses withPvalues estimated using MATLAB’s ‘corr’ function. ANOVA was performed to determine significant differences between multiple groups using Tukey’s honestly significant difference procedure to correct for multiple pairwise comparisons. The box plots in Fig.1fwere generated based on the built-in MATLAB function ‘boxplot’; the central lines indicate the median, the box limits show the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers extend from the minimal to maximal values that are not considered outliers, which were defined by exceeding 1.5× the interquartile range. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks in figures. Custom MATLAB codes were used to calculate binomial tests and to generate Venn diagrams (MATLAB Central File Exchange, M. Nelson 2023, v.2.0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24813-mybinomtest-s-n-p-sided; Darik 2023, v.1.7,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22282-venn).

*** To identify odour-modulated neurons, we first calculated azvalue for the firing rate during a response interval ([0, 2 s] after odour onset compared to [−5, 0 s] before odour onset) and performed a one-way ANOVA for odour identity. Neurons with a significant effect of odour identity across all 128 trials (P< 0.05) were termed odour-modulated neurons. Normalized PSTHs (Fig.1j) were calculated by binning the spiking of each neuron (50 ms bins) andz-scoring all bins using the bins in the [−5, 0 s] baseline window before odour onset.

*** In analogy to our definition of odour-modulated neurons, we identified image-modulated neurons based on a one-way ANOVA of thez-scored firing rates for image identity ([0, 1 s] after image onset compared to [−0.5, 0 s] before the image onset27,73,74). Neurons with a significant effect of image identity across all 128 trials (P< 0.05) were termed image-modulated neurons.

*** All decoding analyses were performed using the Neural Decoding Toolbox33(v.1.0.4). In each region, spiking data were first binned within a [0, 2 s] time window after odour onset and a [0, 1 s] time window after image onset. We trained a maximum-correlation-coefficient classifier to predict odour or image identity, using 8 cross-validation data splits and 10 resample runs. To compare decoding performance across regions, an equal number of neurons (n= 200) was subsampled in each decoding analysis. The decoding was repeated 1,000 times on random subsamples. Significance levels were estimated based on a surrogate distribution derived from decoding analysis on label-permuted data (nperm= 1,000). The percentile of the actual data mean within the surrogate distribution was used to estimatePvalues. To evaluate the impact of the decoding time window (Fig.2d), we repeated the decoding analysis, systematically varying the decoding time interval ranging from 50 ms up to 4,000 ms, with 50 ms increments and 100 subsampling runs. Moreover, we systematically varied the number of neurons included in the decoding analysis, starting with 10 neurons and increasing in steps of 10 (Fig.2c). For cross-modal decoding, we trained the classifier on the image trials and tested it on the odour trials (Fig.5e) and vice versa (Fig.5f) using the [0, 2 s] decoding time window. To ensure that our decoding results were not driven by systematic differences of the first compared to later trials, we repeated the decoding without the first trial and obtained overall consistent findings (Extended Data Fig.9). In the population decoding, equal numbers of neurons are randomly sampled across recording sessions, enabling a balanced comparison of performance between regions irrespective of individual variations in neuronal yield. Comparing decoding performance of randomly sampled neurons within and across recording sessions yielded consistent results (Extended Data Fig.9g), indicating that population decoding extrapolates well to larger populations of neurons. The odour-decoding performance for each session was estimated based on all recorded neurons per region with a minimum of 2 neurons, using all odour presentations, 8 cross-validation data splits and 1,000 resample runs. For each session and region, a surrogate distribution was estimated by repeating the decoding analysis 1,000 times on odour-label-permuted data, using 10 resample runs each. The percentile of the actual decoding performance within this surrogate distribution was used to estimatePvalues. Decoding performances per participant were evaluated by averaging decoding performances across repeated sessions within anatomical target regions. To test whether neural activity predicted chemical odour identity better than perceived odour identity (that is, sometimes falsely selected odour labels), we used a decoding analysis during the odour-identification task (4 trials per odour). An equal number of neurons was randomly subsampled from recordings in which each odour was chosen at least twice. In each anatomical target region, 100 neurons were randomly subsampled 1,000 times, and a decoder was trained using two cross-validation data splits and ten resample runs. Decoders were trained based both on chemical odour identity and perceived odour identity (selected odour label) using the same neuronal populations. The differences between the two decoding accuracies were used to assess which labels were predicted more accurately by neuronal firing.

*** A widely used measure of population sparseness is the activity ratioAk, defined as75,76

*** wherexiis the mean response activity of theith neuron to the stimulusk, andNis the number of neurons. The overall sparseness of the population to a set of different stimuli was estimated by averaging across stimuli. We use the sparseness indexSIk= (1 −Ak)/(1 − 1/N) to obtain a measure of sparseness ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to a sparser code34.

*** Each odour was presented eight times. For each odour-modulated neuron, we calculated the meanz-scored firing rate for each odour presentation, resulting in eight firing-rate values per neuron. We then performed a linear regression for each neuron (firing rates versus odour presentation) and used the resulting slopes as a measure of change in the firing rate, following previous studies46. Slopes were calculated for each region and compared with a constant response strength (that is, a slope of 0) using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

*** Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were used to control for recordings across multiple sessions within and across participants. A GLMM was used for each fixed effect to predict trial-wise spike counts of odour-modulated neurons using MATLAB’s ‘fitglme’ function. Brain regions and interactions were incorporated as fixed effects. Participant identity and recording session per participant were included as random effects to account for their nested hierarchical nature77. Each fixed-effects regressor was incorporated as a random slope for both participant identity and participant-session nesting, and neuron identity was included with an individual intersect to account for participant–session–neuron nesting78. All random effects comprised an individual intersect. Likelihood ratio tests (MATLAB’s ‘compare’ function) confirmed that the full models that we used with both random slopes and intercepts outperformed models incorporating only random intercepts. Poisson models were fitted based on the restricted maximum pseudo likelihood with a logarithmic link function.

*** For SEM analysis, two microwires from a new bundle were used. One microwire was trimmed using a scalpel, while the other remained uncut. For imaging, wires were shortened to approximately 8 mm in length and mounted onto aluminium stubs using conductive carbon tape. The samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm of gold using a Quorum 150 R ES coating unit (Quorum Technologies) and imaged using the Everhart–Thornley secondary electron detector in a Zeiss Sigma 300 (Zeiss) Field Emission Gun SEM operated at 2 kV. In total, five images of two scalpel-trimmed microwires and four images of two untrimmed microwires were obtained.

*** a, Same as Fig.1h, but averaged across recording sessions per participant. Proportions of odour-modulated neurons (mean ± s.e.m.) across regions for each participant. Significant proportions of odour-modulated neurons were found in PC, amygdala, EC and hippocampus across participants (PC: 39.7 ± 6%,n= 9 participants,P= 0.002; amygdala: 19.8 ± 3.4%,n= 17,P= 0.00033; EC: 14.2 ± 3.6%,n= 15,P= 0.027; hippocampus: 10.9 ± 1.9%,n= 17,P= 0.0043; PHC: 5.14 ± 1.8%,n= 17,P= 0.79; one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank against chance).

*** a, Respiration was measured with thoracic (upper, turquoise) and abdominal (lower, lilac) inductive plethysmography belts. Respiration signals were amplified and recorded using the Neuralynx ATLAS system, ensuring reliable temporal synchronization with neural recordings.b, Performance (adjusted R2) of linear regression models, predicting neuronal firing (z-scores) based on odour identity, or odour identity combined with respiration (inhalation depth). Adding respiratory information to odour identity did not significantly improve the model predictions of firing rates of odour-modulated neurons (odour identity & respiration (R2= 0.194 ± 0.008) versus odour identity alone (R2= 0.190 ± 0.008),n= 240 odour-modulated neurons with respiratory recordings,Z= 0.85,P= 0.39 two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank). Thus, odour-modulated neurons are primarily driven by odour-specific differences and not variations in respiration.c, Averaged odour-locked respiratory signals for each individual recording session (mean ± s.e.m., 13 sessions withn= 128 trials each). Participants consistently inhaled once (single peak) during the first 2 seconds after odour onset (grey shaded area), the analysis time window used for identification of odour-modulated neurons. n.s. = not significant. Diagrams were created using BioRender (a) and Noun Project (a).

Averaging the decoding performance across all sessions per participant (mean ± s.e.m., black) demonstrated significant odour identity decoding in PC, amygdala, and EC (PC: 7 out ofn= 9 participants,P= 2.6·10−8; amygdala: 10 ofn= 17,P= 1.4·10−9; EC: 4 ofn= 15,P= 0.0055; hippocampus: 3 ofn= 17,P= 0.050; PHC: 0 ofn= 16,P= 1; right-sided binomial test withPchance= 0.05). See also Fig.2b.b, Odour-decoding accuracy and behavioural odour-identification performance across regions and participants, averaged across sessions for each participant (coloured dots). Decoding accuracy in the hippocampus positively correlated with odour-identification performance across participants (Spearman correlation, PC:n= 9 participants,r= 0.15,P= 0.71; amygdala:n= 17,r= 0.10,P= 0.71; EC:n= 15,r= 0.01,P= 0.96; hippocampus:n= 17,r= 0.50,P= 0.043; PHC:n= 16,r= 0.15,P= 0.58, two-sided permutation test). Linear regressions (black) with 95%-confidence intervals (grey).c, Odour identification improves with more odour-modulated neurons in the hippocampus and EC. Percentage of odour-modulated neurons and performance for each recording session for different regions. Percentage of odour-modulated neurons in the EC and hippocampus is positively correlated with individual performance in the odour identification task (Spearman correlation, PC:n= 17 sessions,r= −0.04,P= 0.89; amygdala:n= 27,r= 0.15,P= 0.44; EC:n= 22,r= 0.49,P= 0.022; hippocampus:n= 27, r = 0.38,P= 0.049; PHC:n= 26,r= 0.15,P= 0.47, two-sided permutation test). Linear regressions (black) with 95%-confidence intervals (grey).d, Image-decoding accuracy (mean ± s.e.m., black) per recording session and region (coloured dots). Despite the limited and variable neuron count per session, image identity could be decoded significantly above chance (6.25%, dashed horizontal line) across sessions in PC, amygdala, EC, and hippocampus (PC: 7 out ofn= 17 sessions showed significant decoding compared to 1,000 image-label-permuted data,P= 9.7⋅10−6; amygdala: 5 out ofn= 20,P= 0.0026; EC: 5 out ofn= 15,P= 0.00061; hippocampus: 10 out ofn= 20,P= 1.1⋅10−8; PHC: 2 out ofn= 17,P= 0.21; right-sided binomial test withPchance= 0.05, regions with ≥ 2 neurons in recordings with both olfactory and visual task).e-f, Cross-modal decoding per session trained on images and evaluated on odours (e), and vice versa (f), revealed significant cross-modal coding in PC and amygdala (Image-to-odour: PC: 4 out ofn= 17 sessions,P= 0.0088; amygdala: 2 out ofn= 20,P= 0.26; EC: 0 out ofn= 15,P= 1; hippocampus: 2 out ofn= 20,P= 0.26; PHC: 0 out ofn= 17,P= 1; Odour-to-image: PC: 0 out ofn= 17,P= 1; amygdala: 4 out ofn= 20,P= 0.016; EC: 1 out ofn= 15,P= 0.54; hippocampus: 2 out ofn= 20,P= 0.26; PHC: 0 out ofn= 17,P= 1; right-sided binomial test withPchance= 0.05, regions with ≥ 2 neurons in recordings with both olfactory and visual task as in (d)). ****P< 0.0001, ***P< 0.001, **P< 0.01, *P< 0.05.

*** a, Population sparseness index in response to odours for each recording session and odour (mean ± s.e.m. in black). Sparseness significantly differed across recording sites (one-way ANOVA,F3,1367= 90.1,P< 10−10). All pairwise tests significant (P< 0.05) following Tukey’s honestly significant difference procedure, except the pairwise comparison of amygdala and hippocampus (P= 0.11).b, Average respiratory traces (mean ± s.e.m.) for each odour presentation (trials 1 to 8) across 13 recording sessions.c, Averaged inhalation depth (mean ± s.e.m., black) for each odour presentation (1 to 8) and recording session (coloured dots). Inhalation depth was consistent across odour repetitions (one-way ANOVA,F7,96= 0.3,P= 0.95,n= 13 recording sessions with 8 trials each).d, Average response strength for repeated odour presentations across all recorded neurons in each anatomical region (mean ± s.e.m.). Odour repetitions are approximately 5 min apart. Insets depict the mean response slopes per region (mean ± s.e.m.). Significance is based on a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank against a slope of zero (PC:n= 276 neurons,Z= −3.1,P= 0.002; amygdala:n= 617,Z= −6.6,P< 10−10; EC:n= 464,Z= −4.1,P= 4.2⋅10−5; hippocampus:n= 633,Z= −6.5,P= 1.0⋅10−10; PHC:n= 418,Z= −2.4,P= 0.018, neurons with a non-zero pre-odour baseline firing rate).e, First-trial effect in the human piriform cortex. Changes in firing rates (z-scores, mean ± s.e.m. in black) of odour-modulated neurons between consecutive trials. For each region, we calculated the differences of firing rate between successive trials (i.e., 2nd-1st, 3rd-2nd,…, 8th-7thtrial). Firing rate changes were significantly different across trials and regions (one-way ANOVA,F27,2611= 3.8,P= 1.5⋅10−10,n= 377 neurons). PC neurons showed the most pronounced decline in firing rate from first to second trial, as indicated by the blue cross and error bar. All 27 pairwise comparisons (blue cross versus each of the remaining crosses) were statistically significant (P< 0.05) after Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons across alln= 378 (binomial coefficient for selecting 2 out of 27) pair-wise comparisons. The y-axis is truncated to display 99% of the data to improve visibility. ****P< 0.0001, **P< 0.01, *P< 0.05, n.s. = not significant.

*** a, After automated spike sorting and manual verification, we identifiedn= 2,416 units, with an average of 2.19 ± 0.04 (mean ± s.e.m., dotted vertical line) units per channel. Only channels with at least one recorded unit were included. Cumulative density functions (CDF) per brain region are shown as coloured solid lines in the lower panels.b, Proportions of Inter-spike intervals (ISI) shorter than 3 ms. Units exhibited an average proportion of (mean ± s.e.m.) 0.36 ± 0.01% of ISI intervals below 3 ms. More than 95% of all units showed less than 1.4% of ISIs below 3 ms (dashed vertical line).c, Distribution of mean firing rates (mean ± s.e.m.: 1.62 ± 0.05 Hz, dotted vertical line).d, Spike peak amplitude SNR (mean ± s.e.m.: 11 ± 0.1, dotted vertical line). Peak SNR was calculated by dividing the peak amplitude by the standard deviation of the background activity, estimated based on the median absolute deviation (MAD) as SD = MAD/0.674563.e, Mean spike peak amplitude distribution (mean ± s.e.m.: 44.8 ± 0.5µV, dotted vertical line).f, Isolation distance (mean ± s.e.m.: 66 ± 12, for the 1786 clusters for which this measure could be calculated).

*** a, Odour-identity decoding accuracy based on neuronal activity separated by region. Each red dot in the distributions shows the decoding performance based on 200 randomly drawn neurons (1,000 subsampling runs). Mean decoding performance and s.e.m. across subsampling runs are shown in black. Grey dots indicate decoding performance on label-permuted data. The dashed horizontal line indicates chance level (6.25%). Significance based on percentile of mean decoding performance of the real data in the surrogate distribution (PC:P< 0.001; amygdala:P< 0.001; EC:P< 0.001; hippocampus:P< 0.001; PHC:P= 0.12, label permutation test withn= 1,000 permutations).b, Performance of odour-identity decoding (mean ± s.e.m.) as a function of the number of neurons included in the decoding analysis using 100 subsampling runs. Horizontal bars indicate neuron counts for which decoding performance significantly exceeded chance (P< 0.05, right-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank against chance after Bonferroni correction for different neuron counts).c, Performance of odour-identity decoding (mean ± s.e.m.) as a function of the decoding time-window beginning at odour onset using 200 randomly drawn neurons and 100 subsampling runs. Horizontal bars indicate times where decoding performance significantly exceeded chance (P< 0.05, right-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank against chance after Bonferroni correction for 80 decoding time windows; beginning of sustained significant decoding: PC: 400 ms; amygdala: 350 ms; EC: 800 ms; hippocampus: 1,050 ms; PHC: 1,600 ms).d, Image-identity decoding accuracy based on neuronal activity separated by region, depicted as in (a). All regions exhibited significant decoding of image identities (PC:P< 0.001; amygdala:P< 0.001; EC:P< 0.001; hippocampus:P< 0.001; PHC:P= 0.003, label permutation test withn= 1,000 permutations, as in (a)). Decoding accuracy in PC surpassed all other regions.e-f, Decoding accuracy (as in a) for a cross-modal decoding analysis trained on images and evaluated on odours (e), and vice versa (f). (Image-to-odour: PC:P= 0.008; amygdala:P= 0.018; EC:P= 0.15; hippocampus:P= 0.1; PHC:P= 0.79; Odour-to-image: PC:P= 0.17; amygdala:P= 0.14; EC:P= 0.45; hippocampus:P= 0.28; PHC:P= 0.7, label permutation test withn= 1,000 permutations, as in (a)). PC and amygdala reached substantially higher decoding accuracies than any of the other regions in both cross-modal decoding analyses.g, Odour-decoding accuracy as a function of the number of neurons used for decoding, sampled across participants (red, mean ± s.e.m.) or within participants (blue, mean ± s.e.m. across sessions), as in Fig.2c(100 times randomly subsampled with 8 cross-validation data splits and 10 resample runs). Chance level (6.25%) shown as dashed horizontal line.
