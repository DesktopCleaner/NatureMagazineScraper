*** Endosymbioses have profoundly impacted the evolution of life and continue to shape the ecology of a wide range of species. They give rise to new combinations of biochemical capabilities that promote innovation and diversification1,2. Despite the many examples of known endosymbioses across the tree of life, their de novo emergence is rare and challenging to uncover in retrospect3,4,5. Here we implant bacteria into the filamentous fungusRhizopus microsporusto follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses. WhereasEscherichia coliimplanted into the cytosol induced septum formation, effectively halting endosymbiogenesis,Mycetohabitans rhizoxinicawas transmitted vertically to the progeny at a low frequency. Continuous positive selection on endosymbiosis mitigated initial fitness constraints by several orders of magnitude upon adaptive evolution. Phenotypic changes were underscored by the accumulation of mutations in the host as the system stabilized. The bacterium produced rhizoxin congeners in its new host, demonstrating the transfer of a metabolic function through induced endosymbiosis. Single-cell implantation thus provides a powerful experimental approach to study critical events at the onset of endosymbiogenesis and opens opportunities for synthetic approaches towards designing endosymbioses with desired traits.

*** Intracellular endosymbioses are extraordinarily intimate interactions between organisms. They join two complex metabolic networks in a compartmentalized manner and are subjected to natural selection as a unit. This metabolic integration predisposes endosymbioses to enable major transitions in evolution1,2. Accommodating an endosymbiont can benefit the host by acquiring chemical defence systems and unlocking essential nutrients or new energy sources2,6,7,8. However, many obstacles limit de novo endosymbiogenesis3,4,5. Besides the first hurdle of host cell entry, a prospective endosymbiont must overcome challenges associated with immune responses, metabolism and growth synchronization3,9,10. Even if the combined metabolisms theoretically sustain growth in silico11, unstable outcomes are the prevailing norm, failing to stabilize vertical transmission11,12.

*** Studying established natural partnerships has provided insights into the intricate interactions of extant endosymbioses. These include mitochondria and chloroplasts as relicts of ancient bacterial endosymbionts, as well as insect endosymbionts that have long been vertically transmitted and have undergone genome reduction13. However, shifting balances of control between the partners, phases of stabilization and destabilization and equivocal lines between mutualism and antagonism blur evolutionary trajectories13,14,15,16. Consequently, the earliest steps in endosymbiogenesis remain difficult to uncover15. Synthetic approaches can provide well-defined starting points to follow stable and unstable outcomes. Interventional studies have focused mainly on insects, in which transinfection has revealed important aspects of endosymbiogenesis, such as control of bacterial replication17,18and metabolic cooperation19,20. However, attempts in other phyla, such as installing engineeredE.colior cyanobacteria in yeast21,22, have not resulted in stable endosymbiosis under strict selection.

*** Here we set out to generate a novel endosymbiotic partnership in a non-host filamentous fungus. The model system consisted of the early divergent fungusRhizopusmicrosporusand the cytosolic bacterial endosymbiontMycetohabitans rhizoxinica23,24. Certain host strains ofR.microsporuscontainMycetohabitansendosymbionts25. In these, vertical inheritance is strict, as the fungus cannot sporulate without the endosymbiont, which reliably colonizes the spores26,27. This probably drives co-diversification25. The association is presumed mutually beneficial28, with bacterially produced rhizoxin congeners29,30providing the fungus fitness advantages by protecting against amoeba and nematodes31, and aiding in nutrient acquisition by causing rice seedling blight23. Both partners can be cultured axenically, and host strains cured from the endosymbiont are readily reinfected byM.rhizoxinica26,32. By contrast, non-host strains resist natural colonization and do not require endosymbionts for sporangiospore formation33,34. For this study,R.microsporusstrain EH (endosymbiont-harbouring) and strain NH (non-harbouring) were used.

*** To study initial endosymbiogenesis events, we used single-cell approaches to observe cellular responses before environmental selection could act. Fluidic force microscopy (FluidFM)35was recently adapted to inject bacteria into mammalian cells, bypassing cellular entry steps and enabling evaluation of engineered pairs to test intracellular growth36,37. Applying this technique to fungi is challenging owing to the complexity of fungal mycelia, the rigid cell wall and high turgor pressure38,39. In this work, we report a procedure to implant bacteria intoR.microsporusthat enabled real-time tracking using confocal microscopy and characterizing early adaptations in the endosymbiosis under stabilizing selection pressure.

*** We have previously shown that with FluidFM, bacteria can be injected into mammalian cells36,37and small molecules can be injected into fungi39. However, the physical placement of bacteria into a fungal hypha had not been achieved with this technique and is experimentally more challenging. We used cylindrical tips with aperture sizes of 500–1,000 nm to allow the passage of bacteria while minimizing wound size. To improve our ability to puncture fungal cells, we sharpened the apex of the cylindrical FluidFM probes into a double point using focused ion beam milling (Fig.1) and increased the applied force. In addition, the cell wall of the germlings was softened using an enzyme mixture in osmoprotective solution. Despite this treatment, pressures up to 6.5 bar were necessary for injection. With this approach, we were able to implant about 1–30 bacteria per injection event into anR.microsporusgermling. The workflow also allowed isolation of injected germlings, subsequent imaging of fluorescently tagged bacteria inside the host cell, and culturing of the isolated germlings on agar plates to grow them until sporulation (Fig.1).

*** FluidFM injection takes place on a glass dish surface placed above an inverted confocal light microscope. The probe apex is sharpened to a double point with an aperture of 500 to 1,000 nm. Inset: focused ion beam image of probe apex; scale bar, 500 nm. The turgor of the hypha is overcome by applying up to 6.5 bar overpressure. After the injection, the still-attached germling can be isolated into an empty dish, in which the recovery and growth of the microorganisms can be observed. The injected germling can subsequently be detached from the probe and transferred to a Petri dish for further cultivation until sporulation. Created withBioRender.com.

*** Injection ofM.rhizoxinicalabelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) into its natural hostR.microsporusstrain EH confirmed that both partners survived the injection procedure. Colonization was validated by microscopic observation (Supplementary Video1). On the basis of the velocity, bidirectionality, the tracks followed and the motion in relation to the general cytoplasmic contents, the bacteria are probably moving both by active transport along microtubules and by passive transport through cytoplasmic bulk flow (Supplementary Videos2and3). Microtubules have been shown to be involved in the transportation ofWolbachia-containing vesicles inDrosophila40, but not in the transport of directly cytosolic endosymbionts or in fungi. We speculate thatM.rhizoxinicamay be able to attach to the microtubule-dependent motors dyneins and kinesins, through fungal cargo adaptor proteins or hitchhiking adaptor proteins41. The inhibition of dynein by transient exposure to ciliobrevin D, a reversible and cell-permeable small molecule, led to the transient cessation of bacterial transport within the germling (Supplementary Video4).

*** To follow the expected vertical transmission of the endosymbiont in this reconstituted natural endosymbiosis, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and microscopy to accurately classify large numbers of spores for their colonization status with fluorescently labelled bacteria. This analysis confirmed the stable inheritance of the implanted bacteria in spores.

*** After reconstituting the natural endosymbiosis as proof of concept, we investigated the fate of the a priori non-endosymbiotic but intracellularly viable bacterium,E.coli, insideR.microsporus. E.colihas been shown to multiply rapidly in the cytosol of mammalian cells, resulting in host cell killing36. We injected GFP-labelledE.coliintoR.microsporusstrain EH and strain NH (Fig.2aand Supplementary Videos5and6). After injection, both partners remained viable, butE.coliintracellular replication and localization dynamics differed substantially from that ofM.rhizoxinicain its natural host.E.coliproliferated more rapidly within the hyphae, dividing bacteria generally stayed together, and the resulting bacterial clumps dispersed only slowly, following the cytoplasmic bulk flow within hyphae (Supplementary Videos5and6). Combined, these dynamics led to the emergence of local hotspots with high bacterial density. The fungi formed septa around these densely populated areas, resulting in compartments with and withoutE.coli. Bacteria-free compartments continued to grow normally, whereas compartments with bacteria became entirely filled, and occasionally burst open (Supplementary Videos5and6). Defence by septa formation has previously been observed withR.microsporusstrain EH responding toM.rhizoxinicamutants lacking the effectorMycetohabitanstranscription activator-like effector 1 (MTAL1), which presumably helps the bacterium elude fungal defences42. Although someE.colicells dispersed within individual hyphae over larger distances, leading to the formation of septa at sites remote from the original physical delivery (Fig.2aand Supplementary Video5), noE.colicould be detected in the spores collected from injected fungi, as evaluated by FACS (detection limit 1/1,000,000 positive spores,n= 3; Fig.2c). These experiments showed that the fungus recognized unadapted bacterial intruders and triggered a defence reaction to physically contain the bacteria in separated hyphal compartments, allowing growth to proceed normally in uninfected hyphae.

*** We next sought to generate a novel endosymbiosis by implanting GFP-labelledM.rhizoxinicaintoR.microsporusstrain NH, which naturally does not harbour endosymbionts and readily forms spores without bacterial presence. After injection, the bacteria divided and exhibited transport dynamics similar to those observed in its host strain EH (Fig.2band Supplementary Videos7and8). FACS revealed that a subset of the spores produced by the injected and cultivated germlings were colonized by bacteria (Fig.2c). We confirmed microscopically that the positively sorted spores (≤4%; Extended Data Table1) indeed harboured bacteria (Fig.2d). When exposed to rich medium, some of the positive spores germinated successfully and retained high numbers of replicating bacteria that spread through the hyphae (Fig.2e). These findings showed thatM.rhizoxinicacan be vertically transmitted inR.microsporusstrain NH, and that implantation by FluidFM combined with selection by FACS can expand the host range of an endosymbiotic bacterium to a new host.

*** Building on the observed vertical transmission ofM.rhizoxinicaimplanted into a novel host,R.microsporusstrain NH, we next conducted an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment. To exert a stringent selection pressure, spores containing bacteria were sorted by FACS and propagated through successive rounds of growth and selection (Fig.3a). To start, spores originating from a single injected germling were sorted. The positive spores were split into ten lines and subsequently propagated separately for seven rounds (see Fig.3aandMethodsfor details). Three high-performing lines, and the pooled remaining seven lines, were propagated for three more rounds. After each round of sporulation, we measured the percentage of the spores that contained bacteria (positive fraction), as well as the germination success of these spores. At the beginning of the evolution experiment, the germination success of positive spores was severely impaired. Whereas spores without bacteria had a germination success of 63%, the germination success of spores containing bacteria was reduced tenfold and was only 6.3% (Fig.3b), suggesting that the presence of bacteria imposes a substantial cost on host fitness. The germination success of the positive spores had increased to 75% in the tenth round and was no longer distinguishable from that of spores without bacteria (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.1). Likewise, the positive fraction had increased from 0.01% to up to 24.1% at the end of the experiment (Fig.3c). Both the germination success and the positive fraction directly affected the fitness of the endosymbiosis in an evolutionary sense (that is, the total amount of viable offspring with endosymbiont). We therefore defined the fitness index of the endosymbiosis outcome as the product of the two values. By round 7, the fitness index had increased from the initial 0.0006% to up to 8.7% with an average of 4.4% (Fig.3d). The average fitness index in round 10 reached 14.0%, with the highest value noted for line 4 at 25.3%. An additional cost to the fungus observed over the course of the evolution was a delayed germination for spores with bacteria compared to that for spores without bacteria (Fig.3e). Taken together, the findings of the adaptive laboratory evolution experiment showed that the artificially induced endosymbiosis can be stably propagated in the new host upon positive selection. Over time the fitness index of the endosymbiosis increased, indicating adaptation towards improved transmission.

*** We tested whether the incorporation ofM.rhizoxinicaas a new endosymbiont within the non-host strain NH led to the transfer of the biosynthesis of natural products, analogous to the natural host–endosymbiont system. In the natural system,M.rhizoxinicaproduces macrocyclic polyketides such as WF-1360F, which can be modified byR.microsporusto form rhizoxin and other congeners29, and has been attributed to fitness advantages23,29,30,31. Rhizoxins are toxic to eukaryotic cells because they bind β-tubulin and interfere with microtubule formation43. The resistance of the fungus to rhizoxins is due to a single amino-acid substitution in β-tubulin that is present in most Mucorales, including both strains ofR.microsporusused in this study28. We tested for the production of rhizoxin in the induced endosymbiosis with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. All extracts from plates of the ten evolution lines in round 7 contained rhizoxin congeners. Specifically, WF-1360F and rhizoxin were both found in all lines (Fig.3f,g). The detection of rhizoxin validates the transfer of a metabolic trait to strain NH, which does not naturally generate the natural product.

*** To verify that the marked increase in fitness of the induced endosymbiosis was due to adaptative evolution, and to test whether one or both partners adapted, we carried out a crossover experiment. For the ancestral partners, we used the same starting stocks as for injection to commence the evolution experiment, and for the evolved partners, we chose the best-performing line after ten rounds of propagation (line 4). We isolated the bacterium from line 4 at the end of the evolution (BEvo) and reinjected it into the ancestral fungus (FAnc), and reciprocally injected the ancestral bacterium (BAnc) into the evolved fungus (FEvo; using a bacterium-free spore from the tenth round of line 4). In the first round directly after injection, both cross-pairings had a high germination success, with FAnc–BEvoat 66% ± 17% and FEvo–BAncat 88% ± 5%. Thus, the germination success of FEvo–BAncwas similar to that of the evolved pair (88%) and significantly higher than that of the ancestral pair (39% ± 29%; Fig.4a). When we determined the positive fraction in the subsequent round, FEvo–BAncexhibited a positive fraction of 51% ± 13% (Extended Data Table2). This is even higher than that of the evolved pair (29%), indicative of high fitness and suggesting the possibility of genomic adaptation of the fungus.

*** Source Data

*** In addition to the increases in the positive fraction and germination success throughout the evolution experiment, we observed a lower intensity GFP signal in positive spores from the evolved pair versus the ancestral pair (Fig.4b). To determine whether the evolved spores contained fewer bacteria, or the bacteria present were expressing less GFP, we correlated the GFP signal obtained from FACS with bacterial load by collecting subpopulations of the positive population (Fig.4b) and microscopically assessed the bacterial volume in the spores (Methods, Determination of bacterial load). Spores from lower-intensity gates had a lower bacterial volume than spores from higher-intensity gates (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.2), correlating high GFP intensity as measured by FACS with a higher bacterial load. To evaluate whether the bacterial load influences the ability of the spores to germinate, we determined the germination success of these populations (Fig.4d). In the ancestral pair, we found that spores from the fraction with a lower bacterial load had a higher germination success than the spores with a high bacterial load. In the evolved pair, all spores had a relatively low bacterial load compared to the ancestral pair. Comparing spores from the evolved pair with different levels of bacterial load, we still found a trend, but no significant correlation between bacterial load and germination success (Fig.4d). These findings suggest that a high bacterial load reduces the germination capacity of spores and that the induced endosymbiosis adapted to counteract this issue by reducing the bacterial load.

*** To test how the presence of bacteria affected the germination capacity of spores as they age, we examined the germination periodically over the course of 27 days. The germination success of spores devoid of bacteria remained relatively constant during this time frame (Extended Data Fig.3). By contrast, the germination success of bacteria-containing spores for both FAnc–BAncand the evolved pair decreased substantially over time from more than 50% to below 5% after about a month, suggesting that the presence of bacteria takes a continuous toll on the spores.

*** Next we analysed whether the phenotypic adaptations in the evolution experiment correlated with genetic changes in the evolved populations. We carried out de novo hybrid genome assembly using both long- and short-read sequencing data to assemble a reference genome for strain NH from the start of the adaptive evolution experiment. Short-read sequencing was used to track changes at several rounds of the experiment (Fig.3a) for both the fungus and the bacteria. In the bacteria, we did not detect any mutational changes throughout the evolution experiment. In the fungus, we identified a total of 9 different mutations in four different lines that had an allele frequency of at least 50% (Extended Data Fig.4a). Four mutations were detected in the fittest line, line 4, in which we tracked genetic changes for each passage. The relative frequency of reads carrying the mutation increased sharply towards the end of the experiment and coincided with the increase in the fitness index observed in line 4 (Fig.5a). We further examined whether the high fitness of the FEvo–BAncpairings correlated with the identified mutations and found all four mutations in all three injected FEvogermlings. In two of three germlings, the mutations occurred with a high frequency of 85–100% of reads and in one germling the frequency was considerably lower with only 18–35% of reads (note that asexual spores ofRhizopusare multinucleate44). However, in that germling another mutation was found in 61% of reads (Extended Data Fig.4b). This fifth mutation could be detected in the line 4 population from round 6 onwards, but did not reach the frequency threshold of 50% (Extended Data Table3). The function of the targeted genes remains speculative. Annotations with InterPro45and interaction predictions with STRING46suggest that they might be linked to endocytosis, whereas in other lines transcription, translation, mitochondrial maintenance and ion transport may have been affected (Extended Data Table4). Together, the findings of the sequence analysis confirmed that genomic changes occurred during the adaptive evolution experiment on the host side rather than in the endosymbiont.

*** a, Four mutations in line 4 became prevalent in the host population during the adaptive evolution experiment, correlating with the increase in the fitness index. The graph depicts in solid lines on the leftyaxis the relative frequency of reads with the corresponding mutations compared to the reference sequence. The dashed line on the rightyaxis depicts the fitness index of line 4 over the course of the experiment. Mutations reaching more than 50% relative frequency are shown. ‘del**’ indicates deletion of two base pairs (CGG>C).b, The evolved endosymbiosis is more stable than the ancestral endosymbiosis (FAnc–BAnc) in the absence of artificial selection. The graph shows in colour the fraction of bacteria-positive spores in the absence of artificial selection by FACS, and in grey the predicted positive fraction based on a mathematical model. The model uses the germination success and fraction of bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative spores to predict the fraction of bacteria-positive spores over rounds of propagation in the absence of selection. The upper dotted line indicates the threshold for propagation and diluting out (1/100,000); the lower dotted line indicates the detection limit (1/1,000,000).

*** Source Data

*** In the adaptive laboratory evolution experiment described above, we exerted a strict positive selection pressure using FACS. In nature, the selection pressure could stem from the bacterially transferred metabolic traits, in this case rhizoxin production26,31. However, our initial characterizations of the induced endosymbiosis have also shown substantial costs associated with bacterial occupation, which led to an initially low fitness of the endosymbiosis (Fig.3d). We therefore reasoned that the induced endosymbiosis would be quickly lost in the absence of positive selection, but would persist for longer after adaptation and mitigation of some of the fitness costs.

*** To test the stability of the endosymbiosis, we experimentally measured the positive fraction over five rounds of propagation without positive selection and compared the data to a simple mathematical model predicting the fraction of bacteria-positive spores over time. Parameters for the mathematical model were based on measured values of the starting point, namely, the germination success and the initial positive fraction, which we considered to be the most determining factors. For the experiment, positively sorted spores were plated according to the standard conditions in the evolution experiment. Thereafter, 100,000 spores were collected for further cultivation without selecting for bacterial colonization, while simultaneously measuring the positive fraction (Fig.5b). With the ancestral pair, positive spores diluted out within a single round to below the threshold for propagation (<1/100,000) but were still detectable (>1/1,000,000), which was even faster than the model predicted. For the evolved pair, however, the endosymbiosis was maintained for a longer time as positive spores diluted out after four to five rounds at the rate that was predicted by the model. This supports the earlier finding that adaptive evolution increased the stability of the induced endosymbiosis, and that the positive fraction and germination success are valid predictors of the fitness of the system.

*** The emergence of new endosymbioses remains a challenge to observe and study. We have developed an experimental system that allows real-time investigation of the initial steps in the association of a fungal host with an intracellular bacterium. Such encounters are thought to occur frequently in nature, but will be predominantly unstable and transient3,4,11,47. The direct implantation allows monitoring of the immediate reactions of pairs with varying degrees of preadaptation, and decoupled from hyphal entry.

*** The implantation ofE.coliintoR.microsporusstrains EH and NH resulted in the collapse of the system in a single fungal generation, underscoring the expected instability of new endosymbiotic pairings4. AlthoughE.colirapidly divided in the cytosol (Fig.2a), it was unable to colonize the spores ofR.microsporus, which represents an evolutionary dead end for endosymbiogenesis. The fungus entrapped densely growingE.colithrough induced septum formation (Fig.2aand Supplementary Video5), probably due to recognition by its innate immune system, which is not well understood at present42,48. However,E.coliat low densities were not consistently sealed off, suggesting thatR.microsporuslacks the specificity to clear low-abundance bacteria in its cytosol. This observation implies thatE.colimight be more likely to be vertically transmitted if it grew slower36and/or spread throughout the entire mycelium. The pairing illustrates the necessity for sufficient preadaptation for endosymbiogenesis, as otherwise natural selection cannot begin to take effect.

*** By contrast,M.rhizoxinicaimplanted into the non-hostR.microsporusstrain NH propagated and dispersed in the fungal hyphae without apparent harm to the fungus and without inducing septum formation (Fig.2band Supplementary Video7). The bacterium reached a subset of spores (Fig.2c,d), some of which germinated, allowing vertical inheritance (Fig.2e). We speculate that the bacteria are actively transported along the microtubules, potentially by hitchhiking vesicle transport41. This might help the bacteria to spread in the mycelium (Supplementary Videos2,3and8) and to reach sites where spores form. The colonization of spores in strain NH was notable, because this fungal strain has not evolved to couple spore formation to bacterial presence26. Despite the demonstrated vertical inheritance, the endosymbiosis is rapidly lost in the absence of positive selection (Fig.5b), probably owing to competition by bacteria-free spores and the observed costs of delayed germination and reduced germination success of colonized spores (Fig.3b,e). These results are consistent with resource exploitation by the endosymbiont, an effect previously observed in insects17,18.

*** When subjected to a strong selection pressure using FACS, the artificially induced endosymbiosis became successively more stable, as evidenced by the slower loss of the endosymbiont when selection pressure was lifted (Fig.5b). Two major phenotypic factors contributing to this enhancement were an increased fraction of positive spores and ‘recovery’ of the compromised germination success (Fig.3b,c). Our cross-validation implantations suggested that adaptation of the fungus was the main contributor to stabilization. This finding was substantiated by genome analyses, which showed enriched mutations in the fungal population but not the bacterial one (Fig.5aand Extended Data Fig.4a). This observation is in contrast to findings made in insects, in which the bacterial genome adapts faster49. In the fungal coenocytic system, each nuclear duplication can increase host diversity, possibly allowing the fungus to adapt rapidly.

*** The underexplored genome of this basal fungus makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about which molecular mechanisms were critical to adapt to the induced endosymbiosis, and additional epigenetic effects on either the host or endosymbiont side cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, genetic changes based on rearrangements or larger deletions or duplications may be missed by short-read sequencing. However, several genes affected by mutations may be involved in the regulation of transcription and translation, and in endocytosis (Extended Data Table4). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, we could show phenotypically that the system evolved to increase the number of spores with the bacterium, and we identified reduced bacterial load in the spores as an important factor for the increased germination success (Fig.4b–d).

*** Our findings indicate thatM.rhizoxinicais largely compatible with non-hostR.microsporusstrain NH, but maintaining the endosymbiont requires selection pressure. In the natural endosymbiotic pair, the costs for harbouring the bacterium are probably offset by benefits to the fungus, such as co-production of rhizoxin23,31. We found that the implanted bacterium produced WF-1360F withinR.microsporusstrain NH. We also detected rhizoxin, which is produced whenR.microsporusepoxidizes WF-1360F congeners29, indicating that the ability to modify WF-1360F is not exclusively present inR.microsporusstrains that evolved to harbourM.rhizoxinica. The production of rhizoxin by strain NH demonstrates that metabolic capabilities can be transferred to new organisms by artificially inducing an endosymbiosis through implantation and subsequent selection.

*** In summary, we have successfully adopted the FluidFM technology to implant live bacteria into a fungus. This single-cell approach enables real-time imaging of ensuing interactions and to study the prerequisites for endosymbiogenesis even in short-lived and unstable pairings. Combined with the high-throughput nature and sensitivity of FACS, rare vertical transmission events can be analysed and cultured under strict selection. We found that adaptive evolution increased the stability of the induced endosymbiosis despite high initial costs. The ability to initiate endosymbioses and to explore the boundary conditions for stable inheritance advances synthetic approaches towards biotechnologically relevant designer endosymbionts and sheds light on the evolutionary forces shaping endosymbiogenesis.

E. coliK-12 BW25113 pDGUV-GFP50was cultured in Luria–Bertani broth (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 100 µg ml−1carbenicillin (Roth).R.microsporusstrain NH isR.microsporusCBS 631.82;R.microsporusstrain EH isR.microsporusATCC62417.M.rhizoxinicaHKI-0454 andR.microsporuswere cultured as previously reported42at 28 °C.M.rhizoxinicawas fluorescently labelled with cytosolic GFP using pBBR-P12-GFP51.R.microsporuswas grown on potato dextrose agar (ThermoFisher) at 28 °C with 20 µg ml−1gentamicin. Respective antibiotics for plasmid retention were used as required for the culture of bacteria in all experiments, including the growth of bacteria inside the fungus, in which case, additionally, gentamicin was used to prevent extracellular bacterial growth.

*** The basic setup of the instruments, FluidFM probe processing steps, probe cleaning and probe coating were as previously described36, but the pressure was controlled with a FlowEZ 7000 (Fluigent), in the range of 0–7,000 mbar, using an AT550-9L compressor (WenLing) as pressure source. The probe apex was sharpened with a Helios 5UX DualBeam focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher) as described previously36,52, but to a new shape that resulted in a sharp double point, as shown in Fig.1, by targeting the probe from the front and shaping a centred point with a 60° central angle. The cantilevers of the used probes had a nominal stiffness of 1.6 N m−1. The fungal sample was prepared by seeding spores in 50-mm WillCo glass-bottom dishes (WillCo Well) and adding 4 ml potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium (ThermoFisher) containing 34 µg ml−1chloramphenicol, incubating at room temperature for 14–16 h, washing 1–3 times with 4 ml PDB, depending on germling concentration, exchanging the medium for protoplasting mix (to soften but not completely disintegrate the cell wall; 1.6 g Cellulase Onozuka R10 (Duchefa Biochemie), 40 mg chitinase (Merck), 40 ml iced MMB (0.5 M mannitol, 0.05 M maleate pH 5.5), filtered through a 0.22-µm syringe filter), and incubating for another 3–5 h at room temperature. If germlings were too dense, the sample supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm syringe filter. TheE.colisample was grown in a 10-ml culture in a baffled shake flask overnight at 37 °C, washed three times in Hepes2 buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and adjusted to an optical density of 2 at 600 nm. TheM.rhizoxinicasample was grown in a 2-ml culture in a 12-ml culturing tube for 3 to 5 days at 28 °C and prepared like theE. coliculture. Bacterial suspensions (15 µl) were pipetted into the reservoir of the FluidFM probe. The probe was moved towards the glass surface (z= 0 µm) beside the targeted germling and then retracted to az-value of +8 to +10 µm. The injection site of the germling was chosen on the basis of direct proximity to the glass surface, preferring thick germtube portions. As force-controlled puncturing was not possible owing to the softness of the probe, the germling was punctured by advancing the probe by 10 µm (corresponding to a nominalz-value of +1 µm to −2 µm), holding this position for 5 s and retracting to az-value of +1 to +3 µm. Successful puncturing of the germling could be monitored with wide-field illumination by observing cytoplasmic flow. Immediately following puncture of the germling, the microfluidic system was pressurized with 3–4 bar, stopping turgor-induced backflow into the probe. Subsequently, the pressure was increased to 6.5 bar until liquid flow into the germling was noticed, and then quickly reduced to 3–4 bar to prevent bursting of the germling. Injection of bacteria was confirmed by switching to the fluorescence channel, and then the pressure was slowly reduced to 0 mbar to allow recovery of the germling. The injected germling was isolated to a fresh dish filled with recovery medium (3.8 ml MMB, 1 ml PDB, 160 µl 4 M sorbitol) after 3–10 min, or after the germling recommenced growth. Isolation was carried out by lifting the FluidFM and exchanging the sample dish for the recovery dish, with the germling sticking to the probe. Recovery of the germling and the ensuing dynamics were visualized using time-lapse andz-stack images in the wide-field and the fluorescence channels. Some of the injections were carried out with the addition of 1:1,000 calcofluor white (Merck) in the protoplasting mix and recovery medium to visualize the cell wall. Germlings were grown in recovery medium overnight and then detached from the probe using overpressure, lifting of the FluidFM and scraping with a plastic pipette tip. Mycelium was then transferred to a potato dextrose agar plate and incubated at 28 °C.

*** Spores were collected 6 ± 1 days after injection or plating from spores. Spore solution (8.5% NaCl, 1% Tween 20) was added to plates (16 ml for square plates; 12 ml for round plates), and the spores were thoroughly detached using a spatula. The remaining mycelium was clumped up and gently pressed with the spatula to release the spore solution from the mycelium. The spore solution was filtered through a 10-µm CellTrics filter (Sysmex). Spores were washed three times with 1 ml Hepes2 (relative centrifugal force of 8,000; 2 min) and stored at 4 °C overnight for FACS, or in 50% glycerol at −20 °C (for working stocks) or −80 °C (for long-term storage).

*** Analysis and sorting of spores were conducted at the ETH Flow Cytometry Core Facility on a FACSAria Fusion BSL2 cell sorter (BD). Single spores were selected using SSC-A–FSC-A and FSC-H–FSC-A gates. Colonization by bacteria was checked using an SSC-A–eGFP-A gate. (See Supplementary Fig.1for the gating strategy). For samples for which autofluorescence was suspected to complicate the positioning of the positive gate, an mCherry-A versus PerCP–Cy5-5-A channel was used to check for autofluorescence but was not included in the gating. For determination of the fraction of positive spores, 100,000 to 1,000,000 spores were analysed depending on the size of the fraction. For bulk sorting, spores were sorted into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. For determination of germination success, single spores were sorted into 96-well plates containing 125 µl PDB + 34 µg ml−1chloramphenicol per well. For verification of positive gates, bulk-sorted spores were intermittently checked under the microscope. Collected data were analysed using FlowJo v10 software (BD). For sorting of high, medium and low fractions of positive spores, gates were set qualitatively in the positive population as illustrated in Fig.4b.

*** Single-spore-sorted 96-well plates were incubated at 28 °C and checked visually with a Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V8 microscope (Zeiss) for the appearance of a germling. Per sample, three plates of positive spores and one plate of negative spores were sorted. In round 1 of the adaptive laboratory evolution experiment, five positive plates were sorted per sample. Germlings were counted 1 day and 2 days after sorting, after which point there are no new germlings to be discovered. For positive plates, five germlings were checked microscopically on day 1 to confirm the presence of fluorescent bacteria. If a germling could not be confirmed to have endobacteria, five more germlings were checked. No samples failed this control by having more than 20% of germlings without easily detected endobacteria. To calculate the percentage of delayed germinations, the percentage of germlings not detected on day 1 but detected on day 2 was calculated (with 100% corresponding to the number of germlings detected on day 2).

*** For isolation ofM.rhizoxinicafromR.microsporus, 50 ml MGYM9 + 34 µg ml−1chloramphenicol was inoculated with spores in a 500-ml baffled shake flask and incubated with shaking at 100 r.p.m. for 5–7 days. Build-up of mycelium on the wall was periodically flushed off by gentle shaking and tilting by hand. Once the medium became turbid, an inoculation loop was inserted in the medium, avoiding mycelial clumps and used for streaking out on agar plates. Plates were checked daily for 3 days and growing fungus was cut out if detected. Plates with bacterial colonies were further cultivated according to standard protocols and were used to make cryogenic stocks. Alternatively, a 2-µm syringe filter (Merck) was used to separate bacteria from mycelium and spores, and the filtrate was used for further cultivation in liquid.

*** For the evolution experiment, spores collected in the first round after injection were sorted for determination of germination success, and the remaining spores were bulk sorted for positive spores. The positive spores were split into 10 equal lines, resulting in approximately 300 spores per line. Thereafter, the ten lines were kept separate. The germination success and the fraction of positive spores were determined in every round for every line, and at every round after round 1, some positively and negatively sorted spores were cryopreserved, and bacteria were isolated from 10,000 positively sorted spores (approximately 300 for round 1). The product of the positive fraction and the germination success was calculated to give the fitness index, indicating the percentage of spores that would yield bacteria-populated germlings for the start of a next round without selection. Plating for the evolution experiment was carried out on 120 × 120 mm square Petri dishes (Greiner) to increase the available surface area. Spores to be plated were taken up in 100 µl of buffer, which was pipetted into five parallel lines with equal spacing on the plate. Standard spread plating for high spore numbers had previously proved to lead to inconsistent spore formation. From round 2 on, high densities of spores could be plated for the next round as the fraction of positive spores increased. For making round 3 plates, the highest number of spores was seeded, up to 830,000 spores per plate, whereas for rounds 4 and 5 the numbers varied slightly around 100,000, and from thereon 100,000 were used for all rounds and lines. The number of seeded spores is shown in the Source Data for Fig.3a. After round 7, only the three best-performing lines according to the fitness index were grown individually (lines 2, 4 and 7), whereas the other seven lines were pooled to line P by mixing equal amounts of positive spores. A scheme indicating the population sizes of spores and the pooling regime can be found in Fig.3a.

*** A total of 10,000 positively sorted spores per line from round 7 were plated. Strain EH colonized byM.rhizoxinica, the axenic strain NH and a liquid culture ofM.rhizoxinicaserved as controls. Plates were grown for 11 days and extracted with 50 ml ethyl acetate with shaking at 100 r.p.m. overnight at 28 °C. The organic phase was separated, dried with sodium sulfate, filtered through paper filter, and evaporated with a rotary vacuum evaporator. Samples were taken up in 1 ml acetonitrile, centrifuged at 20,000gfor 10 min and 800 µl of the supernatant was stored at −80 °C until liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis. LC separation was carried out with a Thermo Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) using a C18 reversed-phase column (Kinetex XB-C18 column, particle size 1.7 µm, pore size 100 Å; dimensions 50 mm × 2.1 mm, Phenomenex). Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 500 µl min−1. Solvent B was varied as follows: 0 min, 25%; 3 min, 90%; 5 min, 90%; 5.3 min, 25%; subsequently, the column was equilibrated for 2 min at the initial condition. The injection volume was 2 µl.

*** MS-product reaction monitoring analysis was carried out with a Thermo QExactive plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the positive Fourier transform mass spectrometry mode. MS level 1 scans were carried out with a mass resolution of 35,000 (m/z= 200) and MS level 2 scans were carried out with a mass resolution of 17,500. Parent ions were isolated atm/z594.34, 610.337, 612.3531, 626.3323 and 628.348 with unit resolution and fragmented by high-energy C-trap collision dissociation applying a normalized collision energy of 28 eV. A heated electrospray ionization probe was used with the following source parameters: vaporizer temperature, 380 °C; sheath gas, 50; auxiliary gas, 20; sweep gas, 0; RF level, 50.0; capillary temperature, 275 °C. See Supplementary Fig.2for relevant spectra.

*** For the generation of sequencing samples ofM.rhizoxinica, bacteria were grown according to standard culturing conditions after isolation from the respective time point (Methods, Bacterial isolation), and 4 ml of sample adjusted to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm were pelleted by spinning at a relative centrifugal force of 11,000 for 1 min. Genomic DNA was prepared using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit (LGC). Genomic DNA was sent on dry ice to BMKGene (Biomarker Technologies) for further processing.

*** For generation of sequencing samples ofR.microsporus, mycelium was grown in 500 ml malt extract broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2-l shake flasks for Illumina sequencing or in 1.5-l malt extract broth in 5-l shake flasks for PacBio sequencing at 37 °C for 5 days, with the addition of gentamycin and chloramphenicol. The mycelium was then filtered on a 110-mm filter paper and washed thoroughly with double-distilled H2O and for Illumina samples additionally with 150 ml of 70% ethanol. The mycelium was then removed from the filter paper, packed into a 50- ml screw cap tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then sent to BMKGene (Biomarker Technologies) for further processing.

*** For genome assembly ofR.microsporusCBS 631.82, Pacbio HiFi sequencing with RS II produced a total of 3,867,257,442 base pairs (bp) in 353,300 reads of average length 10.9 kilobases and average quality score 30.3. The reads were assembled with Flye (v2.9.2)53with the --pacbio-hifi flag, resulting in 118 contigs of total length 55,743,399 bp with an N50 (the shortest contig of the set of the largest contigs making up 50% of the assembly) of 1,370,944 bp. BUSCO (v5.4.7)54was used to check the quality of the assembly, using the lineage dataset mucorales_odb10, giving the following result: C (complete): 97.5%, S (single-copy): 5.1%, D (duplicated): 92.4%, F (fragmented): 1.7%, M (missing): 0.8%,n(number of genes): 2,449. Thus, although nearly complete, the genome also seems to be largely duplicated. The assembly was gene-called with BRAKER (v3.0.6)55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62, using the —fungus flag, and then functionally annotated with eggNOG-mapper (v2.1.12)63using the option --target_taxa Fungi. BUSCO reported a slightly improved completeness for the called genes: C: 99.8% [S: 1.4%, D: 98.4%], F: 0.1%, M: 0.1%, n: 2,449.

*** For calling mutations from the adaptive evolution experiment forR.microsporusandM.rhizoxinica, the short-read Illumina sequences provided by BMK were used. The resulting raw reads were cleaned by removing adaptor sequences, low-quality-end trimming and removal of low-quality reads using BBTools v38.18 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). The commands used for quality control can be found on the Methods in Microbiomics web page (https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocessing/preprocessing.html). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were called using two different tools—Snippy and bcftools64. For variant-calling with bcftools, reads were first aligned to the PacBio assembly ofR.microsporusCBS 631.82 or to theM.rhizoxinicareference genome (GCF_000198775.1) using BWA-MEM v0.7 (ref.65). Duplicate reads were marked and removed using GATK4 v4.2 (MarkDuplicates)66. Variants were called using the bcftools call command. Single nucleotide polymorphism calls were validated by comparing results obtained by two independent tools. All the variants that were detected in the ancestral sample were filtered out from all of the evolved samples using bcftools-isec to investigate variants that arose during the evolution experiment. The resulting VCF files were filtered using bcftools with the following criteria: -Ov -sLowQual -g5 -G10 -e ‘QUAL < 200 || DP4[2] < 3 || DP4[3] < 3 || (DP4[2] + DP4[3])/sum(DP4) < 0.1 || MQ < 50’. Each variant call produced by each of the tools was manually checked by analysing the read alignments at variant positions using samtools pileup. Mutations were annotated using SnpEff67and InterProScan45. STRING was used to identify putative biological processes by searching for interactions on the basis of the closest-related genes for fungi found in the STRING database46.

*** Spores for round 0 were first collected from a plate grown according to the standard conditions from the adaptive laboratory evolution experiment. For this, spores from a fresh FAnc–BAncinjection plate were bulk sorted and 100,000 positive spores were plated. For FEvo–BAnc, frozen positive spores from an injection plate were grown and then 100,000 positive spores were plated; for FEvo–BEvo, frozen spores from the evolution experiment from round 10 line 4 were grown and then 100,000 positive spores were plated. From these plates, spores of round 0 were collected. Then 100,000 spores were bulk sorted gating only for single spores but disregarding the GFP signal intensity of the spores and used for subsequent rounds. Every round, 1,000,000 spores per sample were analysed to determine the fraction of positive spores. The endosymbiosis was considered washed out once the positive fraction fell below the threshold of 1/100,000 spores, at which no positive spore is expected to be plated for the next round. The experiment was stopped after round 5. The theoretical trajectory of the positive fraction was calculated using the following formula:

*** wherepis the positive fraction;xis the round for which the positive fraction is being determined;gis the germination success of positive spores as measured in round 0;eis the germination success of negative spores derived from the long-term average from the evolution experiment (69%); andp0is the positive fraction measured in round 0 to describe how many spores formed by bacteria-positive germlings are again bacteria positive.

*** Spores sorted for high, medium and low intensity were imaged in the wide-field and GFP channel to createz-stacks. Overlays of 10 spores per population per sample are shown in Extended Data Fig.2a,band served as visual confirmation for the correlation of GFP intensity as measured by FACS and bacterial population size. Contrast and brightness were kept the same. The volume of voxels considered to be bacteria was calculated using Matlab2018a (Mathworks) using sections of published code36. To gauge the appropriate threshold, the three-dimensional rendering of the resulting voxel cloud was visually inspected, and the diameter of single particles was checked. An example of the resulting three-dimensional rendering of samples is shown in Extended Data Fig.2c.

*** Samples were grown as described in the section entitled Fitness without selection pressure. Single spores were sorted into 96-well plates with 75 µl of Hepes2 + 34 µg ml−1chloramphenicol in each well. Per sample, 15 plates with negative spores and 15 plates with positive spores were sorted. Plates were then incubated at 16 °C. One day before the nominal time point, three plates per condition were activated by adding 125 µl of PDB + 34 µg ml−1chloramphenicol to each well and incubating at 28 °C.

*** Statistical tests indicated in the figure legends were run with GraphPad Prism v9.0.0.

*** Images and videos were edited using Fiji68for contrast,z-stacks, time stamps, overlays and scale bars, as indicated in the respective sections of theMethodsand figure legends. Videos were cut together and labelled using iMovie v10.4 (Apple). Plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 9. Figures were assembled and edited using Adobe Illustrator 2020. Illustrations for Fig.1were created withBioRender.com.
