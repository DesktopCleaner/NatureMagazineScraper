*** In mice, intestinal tuft cells have been described as a long-lived, postmitotic cell type. Two distinct subsets have been identified: tuft-1 and tuft-2 (ref.1). By combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and intestinal organoids, we identify four distinct human tuft cell states, two of which overlap with their murine counterparts. We show that tuft cell development depends on the presence of Wnt ligands, and that tuft cell numbers rapidly increase on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exposure, as reported previously in mice2,3,4. This occurs through proliferation of pre-existing tuft cells, rather than through increased de novo generation from stem cells. Indeed, proliferative tuft cells occur in vivo both in fetal and in adult human intestine. Single mature proliferating tuft cells can form organoids that contain all intestinal epithelial cell types. Unlike stem and progenitor cells, human tuft cells survive irradiation damage and retain the ability to generate all other epithelial cell types. Accordingly, organoids engineered to lack tuft cells fail to recover from radiation-induced damage. Thus, tuft cells represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans.

*** The human intestinal tract is responsible for nutrient uptake and the production of hormones, while protecting against pathogens. These functions are executed by specialized epithelial cells, generated by LGR5+stem cells5. Tuft cells represent one such specialized epithelial subset. Most insights in tuft cell ontology and function derive from mouse studies because of a paucity of human in vitro tuft cell models. Mouse tuft-1 cells express neuronal-type genes, whereas tuft-2 cells appear primarily involved in protective immunity against helminths, protozoans and bacteria6,7,8,9. Murine tuft cells express the cytokine IL-25, which triggers resident type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to secrete IL-13. This cytokine is thought to signal to the LGR5+stem cells and to uncommitted progenitor cells to promote the de novo generation of tuft cells in a positive feedback loop2,3,4. Tuft-2 cells sense microbe-derived metabolic compounds, resulting in enhanced secretion of arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that in turn activate IL-13-producing ILC2s and mucus-secreting goblet cells8,9.

*** Although LGR5+cells represent the ‘workhorse’ stem cells of the intestinal epithelium5, they are highly susceptible to damage and various mechanisms can compensate for stem cell loss in mice. One such mechanism involves plasticity of fated crypt progenitors. Thus, dedifferentiation of secretory progenitors10,11,12,13and enterocyte progenitors14can restore normal numbers of LGR5+stem cells. Also, a subpopulation of quiescent LGR5+stem cells marked by MEX3A can restore stem cell function15. Finally, so-called revival stem cells, defined by transient induction of clusterin (CLU) and SCA1, have been proposed to be key to intestinal regeneration, although it is not known from which cells these revival stem cells derive16,17. The lack of models to study human tuft cell biology impedes the functional characterization and properties of these cells in detail, and human intestinal regenerative stem cells have yet to be identified.

*** To generate a model for visualization and tracking of human intestinal tuft cell dynamics and function, we mined a published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) resource to select markers that are uniformly, yet specifically, expressed among human tuft cells18. We thus identifiedAVIL, a gene encoding for the structural actin-binding protein advillin, to be highly expressed in tuft cells and not in other intestinal epithelial cells (more than 192-fold higher expression than any other epithelial type; Fig.1a), as previously also documented for murine tuft cells19,20. Histological examination confirmed the specificity of AVIL expression in primary human small intestinal and colon tissue (Extended Data Fig.1a).

*** We generated clonal organoid lines from human duodenum, ileum and colon in which we fused a green fluorescent protein (mClover) to the C terminus of AVIL using a CRISPR-assisted non-homologous end-joining approach at theAVILlocus21(Extended Data Fig.1band Supplementary Fig.1a). Following an expansion phase of 4 days, AVIL-Clover organoids were subjected to many differentiation regimens in which growth factors were added either alone or in combination (Extended Data Fig.1c). Using flow cytometry for quantification, we observed the highest frequency of AVIL-Clover+cells in the presence of Wnt (Fig.1band Extended Data Fig.1d,e). No higher tuft cell numbers were reached by blocking Notch signalling using the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT, whereas addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) reduced tuft cell frequency, although these factors increased overall cell survival (Extended Data Fig.1f). The specificity of the reporter lines was confirmed by antibody staining for endogenous AVIL (Extended Data Fig.1g). Like primary tuft cells, organoid-derived AVIL+cells were characterized by flask-shaped contours and intense bundling of actin fibres towards the tip of the tuft (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.1h). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that, like primary tuft cells, organoid-derived tuft cells formed distinctive lateral protrusions or interdigitating spinules22(Extended Data Fig.1i). In agreement with these observations, AVIL+cells expressed high levels of previously described signature tuft cell genes18as demonstrated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and staining in organoids and primary tissue (Extended Data Fig.1j–n).

*** High Wnt levels are present in the intestinal crypts, and inversely correlate with bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling, the latter being a key driver of epithelial differentiation, predominantly active in the intestinal villi23. Removal of the BMP inhibitor Noggin and addition of BMP2 and BMP4 to differentiating organoids reduced tuft cell frequency (Extended Data Fig.2a,b). The observed dependence on Wnt and on BMP inhibition urged us to explore the cellular localization of tuft cells in the human intestine. Indeed, quantifying tuft cells along the crypt–villus axis in the primary human small intestine tissue showed that these cells are predominantly restricted to the crypt area (Extended Data Fig.2c,d).

*** Elevated levels of intestinal IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines related to type 2 immunity, drive tuft cell hyperplasia in mice, proposedly by increasing de novo generation of tuft cells by LGR5+stem cells2,3,4. We explored cytokine receptor expression profiles in human intestinal epithelial lineages. Tuft cells (rather than stem cells) expressed the highest level ofIL13RA1, the gene encoding the shared IL-4 and IL-13 receptor (Extended Data Fig.2e). A 4-day exposure of intestinal organoids to IL-4 and IL-13 (but not to IL-25, IL-27 or SCF (KIT ligand)) induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in AVIL+cell frequency, most evident in the absence of EGF (Fig.1dand Extended Data Fig.2f,g). These results raised the question of whether proliferation of bona fide tuft cells, rather than differentiation of stem or transit-amplifying cells to tuft cells, is the main driver of elevated tuft cell numbers following exposure to IL-4 and IL-13. Notably, imaging of IL-4/IL-13-treated organoids revealed a pattern of clustered tuft cells, suggestive of self-expansion, whereas untreated organoids yielded a more scattered profile (Fig.1eand Extended Data Fig.2h,i). Moreover, a substantial fraction of IL-4/IL-13-induced tuft cells stained for Ki67, pointing towards local proliferation of differentiated tuft cells (Extended Data Fig.2jand Supplementary Video1). These findings were not restricted to in vitro models, as staining in primary human small intestinal tissues also sporadically marked Ki67 signal within AVIL+GNAT3+cells (Fig.1fand Extended Data Fig.2k–o).

*** To further substantiate these findings, we integrated the fluorescent ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI)24in small intestine organoids using a transposon-based system, allowing to track and quantify the mitotic state in organoids. We identified KIT as a tuft cell-specific surface marker (Extended Data Figs.2eand3a–d), showing a more than 98% overlap in three AVIL-Clover reporter organoid lines (Extended Data Fig.3e). This overlap was maintained following exposure to various stimuli (Extended Data Fig.3f,g), confirming KIT as a robust antigen that specifically marks tuft cells among human intestinal epithelial cells. We further confirmed KIT specificity in both healthy and inflamed intestines, by analysing publicly available scRNA-seq data of human colon epithelium, obtained from a cohort of paediatric and adult healthy and inflammatory bowel disease tissues25(Extended Data Fig.3h). Likewise, scRNA-seq of KIT-sorted cells from human adult ileum and colon primary tissue revealed that more than 97% of sorted cells showed a tuft cell transcriptional signature (Extended Data Fig.3i,j). Thus, KIT specificity allowed us to simultaneously stain tuft cells and track their cell cycle progression with the FUCCI construct by flow cytometry analysis.

*** Following IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation, up to 8% of the KIT+fraction entered the S/G2/M-phase, whereas the KIT−fraction remained quiescent (less than 1% cycling) (Fig.1g). Of note, non-cytokine-exposed tuft cells were occasionally found in the S/G2/M-phase (Extended Data Fig.3kand Supplementary Video2). Using live-cell imaging, we observed IL-4/IL-13-stimulated AVIL+cells that divided twice over a 36-hour period (Fig.1h, Extended Data Fig.3l,mand Supplementary Videos3–5). In agreement with these findings, IL-4/IL-13 stimulation promoted continuous cycling of tuft cells, as determined using FUCCI organoids (Supplementary Fig.1l) and a steady increase in Ki67+AVIL+cell frequency over a 7-day period (Extended Data Fig.3n). These processes were enhanced in the presence of Wnt signalling (Extended Data Fig.3o). Exposure of IL-4 and IL-13 to organoids that did not contain tuft cells (that is, organoids differentiated in the absence of Wnt), did not result in tuft cell expansion (Extended Data Fig.3p), neither did we observe tuft cells in sorted and cultured stem cells in expansion medium in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13 over a 7-day period (Extended Data Fig.3q). This uncoupled IL-4/IL-13-induced tuft cell proliferation from induced differentiation of precursor cells. Taken together, we found tuft cells to be capable of robust proliferation following type 2 cytokine stimulation in situ.

*** To gain a better understanding of tuft cell function and heterogeneity, we obtained scRNA-seq data from 953 ileum organoid-derived epithelial cells, cultured in tuft cell differentiation medium with and without exposure to IL-4/IL-13. We used the AVIL-Clover signal to select for tuft cells, resulting in 580 high-quality AVIL-expressing cells and 373 cells from other epithelial lineages (Extended Data Fig.4a–c). The MetaCell package26grouped cells into transcriptionally homogeneous subsets, identifying four distinct clusters, which we succinctly named tuft-1 to tuft-4 (Fig.2a,b). Non-tuft cells were identified asLGR5+stem cells and two types of goblet cell (Extended Data Fig.4d). All four tuft cell clusters shared a unique tuft cell core gene-expression program (absent from the non-tuft cell fraction), including the genesALOX5AP,POU2F3,LRMP,GNG13,BMX,AVIL,GNAT3andKIT(Fig.2cand Extended Data Fig.4e). We also identified genes not previously linked to tuft cells, such as the neuropeptide neuromedin U (NMU), and the tyrosine-protein kinaseHCK(Fig.2c). Relative tuft cell subset distribution largely depended on medium composition: addition of IL-4 and IL-13 caused a shift towards tuft-3 and tuft-4 (comprising 14.25% and 79% of all IL-4/IL-13-stimulated tuft cells, respectively), whereas under ‘homeostatic’ differentiation conditions these populations were much rarer (3.5% and 3.25%; Fig.2d). Note that the ratio of tuft cell substates was determined within treatment groups, and that the absolute number of tuft cells within IL-4/IL-13-treated organoids was roughly 10- to 20-fold higher than within non-cytokine-treated organoids (Fig.1d). Direct comparison of the individual tuft cell substates to other epithelial cells showed unique and shared gene-expression patterns for each subset, with tuft-3 expressing the largest number (more than 250) of unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by tuft-2 and tuft-4 (Extended Data Fig.4f).

*** Gene ontology analysis of the DEGs within each tuft cell cluster highlighted the diversity between tuft-1 to tuft-4 (Extended Data Fig.4g). For example, genes that were enriched in tuft-1 cells are involved in processes of neuron differentiation (for example,VIMandSEMA3C), and tuft-2 genes are involved in immuno-potent lipid biosynthetic processes such as the synthesis of lipoxins, prostaglandins and cysteinyl-leukotrienes. Tuft-3 is enriched for genes connected to a cycling phenotype, with high gene-expression levels ofMKI67,TOP2A,TUBBandCKS1B, and tuft-4 cells express genes that are involved in regulating immune responses and stimulating regeneration, such as genes encoding the SOCS proteins, PD-L1 (CD274),EREG,HB-EGFandTACSTD2, among others (Fig.2e). Staining AVIL-Clover reporter organoids with tuft cell state-specific markers further confirmed the observed tuft cell heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig.4h).

*** We next asked whether the heterogeneity we observed in organoid tuft cells informed on tuft cell heterogeneity in vivo. In our dataset of KIT-sorted tuft cells from human adult ileum and colon primary tissue, we found a small subset of cells showing a large repertoire of tuft-3 genes, indicating that tuft cells enter the cell cycle in vivo (Extended Data Fig.4i,j). Combining 2 published datasets spanning 14 healthy donors18,27, we estimated that 3.9% of intestinal tuft cells are cycling in steady state (Extended Data Fig.4k). We also detected coordinated expression of tuft-4 genes in a gradient-like manner in primary ileum and colon tuft cells, suggesting variable levels of IL-4/IL-13 activation in the homeostatic intestine (Extended Data Fig.4l–m). We noted that tuft-3 cells in vivo show a significantly higher tuft-4 activation signature compared to other tuft cells, linking tuft cell proliferation to cytokine stimulation, similar to our observations in vitro (Extended Data Fig.4n,o).

*** Taken together, we observed heterogeneity within the human intestinal tuft cell lineage. At steady state, the predominant subsets represent tuft-1 and tuft-2, which phenocopied the two previously described murine intestinal crypt tuft cell subsets1. IL-4 signalling triggered induction of cycling tuft-3 cells and the notable expansion of tuft-4, the latter not recognized in mouse and probably involved in immune regulation and/or epithelial renewal.

*** Next, we explored the transcription factor repertoire of tuft cells, identifyingPOU2F3, among others, to be uniquely and uniformly expressed by tuft cells in intestinal organoids and tissue (Extended Data Fig.5a,b). Using conventional CRISPR–Cas9 and base-editing techniques28, we generated knock-outs of prominent tuft cell-expressing transcription factors in AVIL-Clover reporter organoids (Extended Data Fig.5c) and tested their effect on tuft cell frequency by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig.5d). By quantifying tuft cell frequency in ‘homeostatic’ differentiation medium and IL-4/IL-13-induced medium, we observed thatPOU2F3and the Wnt-signal transducerTCF7are essential for tuft cell development (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.5e). Accordingly, POU2F3 colocalized with AVIL in sections of organoids generated from small and large intestines, as well as at the transcript and protein levels in primary intestinal tissue (Fig.2g,hand Extended Data Fig.5f–h). Knocking outSPIB, a transcription factor that is shared with M cells and BEST4+cells18,29, partially reduced tuft cell numbers. In addition, we found that organoids mutant forHMX2retained normal tuft cell numbers when cultured in homeostatic differentiation medium, but essentially lost the tuft cell proliferation response to IL-4 and IL-13, consistent with the differential expression ofHMX2in tuft-3 and tuft-4 (Fig.2fand Extended Data Fig.5a). Of note, several conflicting studies in mice reported tuft cell dependence on the secretory lineage-defining transcription factorATOH1(ref.30). We did not detectATOH1expression in human tuft cells, and ectopic overexpression ofATOH1in AVIL-Clover reporter organoids had a negative effect on tuft cell frequency (Extended Data Fig.5i,j). Of note,ATOH1overexpression induced goblet cells and Paneth cells but not enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (Extended Data Fig.5k). Paradoxically, knocking outATOH1resulted in a strong reduction in tuft cell frequency, whereas IL-4/IL-13-induced tuft cell proliferation was not affected (Extended Data Fig.5l–n). Analysis of tuft cell-state-specific markers did not point towards the loss of a specific subset (Extended Data Fig.5o). Thus,ATOH1appears to be instrumental in a developmental phase towards tuft cells, but dispensable for tuft cell maintenance. Taken together, we identified four tuft cell states, which developed in aPOU2F3- andTCF7-dependent manner, whereas IL-4/IL-13-induced tuft cell expansion depended onHMX2.

*** Given the capacity of the tuft cells to expand, we next explored their organoid-forming potential. We purified S/G2/M+tuft cells and non-tuft cells from IL-4- and IL-13-treated FUCCI organoids (Extended Data Fig.6a). Small spheroids appeared from sorted single KIT+cells at day 3 when cultured in expansion medium (Fig.3a). Following passaging, tuft cell-derived organoids appeared larger than non-tuft cell-derived organoids (Extended Data Fig.6b). Similar results were obtained with sorted organoid-derived single AVIL+cells and adult tissue-derived KIT+cells (Extended Data Fig.6c,d), albeit at a lower frequency, probably as it contained all tuft cell states rather than proliferating tuft cells only. Of note, following seeding, AVIL+cells rapidly downregulated tuft cell-specific genes such asAVILand upregulated stem cell markers such asLGR5(Extended Data Fig.6e).

*** In expansion medium and following differentiation, either with or without IL-4 and IL-13, tuft cell- (as determined by expression of KIT or AVIL) and non-tuft cell-derived organoids showed similar expression levels of genes that define absorptive enterocytes (FABP1), goblet cells (MUC2), tuft cells (AVIL) and stem cells (LGR5) (Extended Data Fig.6f). However, tuft cell-derived organoids expressed higher levels of the EEC markerCHGAin differentiation medium without IL-4 and IL-13, which was subsequently confirmed by histological analysis (Extended Data Fig.6g).

*** This observed divergence inCHGAexpression between tuft cell- and non-tuft cell-derived organoids normalized following further passaging (Extended Data Fig.6h,i), indicating that the balance between the distinct epithelial subtypes is reestablished over time. In agreement with this, no differences in cell frequencies between passaged tuft cell- and non-tuft cell-derived organoids were detected by scRNA-seq analysis (Fig.3b,cand Extended Data Fig.6j,k). Of note, the depicted marker genes were highly enriched in tuft cells. For example,AVIL,POU2F3andKITexpression was 75-, 20- and 220-fold higher in tuft cells compared to other epithelial cell types, respectively (Extended Data Fig.6j).

*** This transient effect onCHGAexpression could not be explained by tuft cells expressing theCHGAgene themselves, as wild-type (WT) organoid-derived AVIL+purified cells did not expressCHGA, whereas the AVIL−population did (Extended Data Fig.7a). Indeed, imaging, as well as flow cytometry analysis of differentiated organoids, confirmed the mutually exclusive expression of AVIL against either chromogranin A or chromogranin B (Extended Data Fig.7b–d).POU2F3-deficient organoids showed reducedCHGAexpression and protein levels in tuft cell differentiation medium (Extended Data Fig.7e–g), suggesting the involvement of tuft cells in developing and/or maintaining EEC frequency. Moreover, culture conditions that are known to enhance EEC development and maturation31inducedCHGAexpression only in WT organoids, and not inPOU2F3−/−organoids (Extended Data Fig.7h).

*** We formulated two alternative explanations toCHGAdependence on tuft cells: either tuft cells act as support cells for EEC development in a paracrine manner, or tuft cells are precursors to EECs. To address this question, we mixed cells from H2B-iRFP-labelled WT organoids (WTRed) andPOU2F3−/−organoids, forming mosaic organoids (Extended Data Fig.7i–k). Following differentiation,CHGA,SSTandTPH1expression was enriched in WTRed+cells, but showed low expression in thePOU2F3−/−cells (Extended Data Fig.7l), suggesting a paracrine effect. We further implemented a CRISPR–Cas9-mediated organoid lineage-tracing strategy (Fig.3d). Here, CreERT2is under the control ofAVILexpression, driving the excision of a stop-sequence that activates a viral promotor-induced H2B-iRFP construct, following tamoxifen administration. We observed expression of iRFP+cells that lost AVIL expression, representing tuft cell progeny (Extended Data Fig.7m,n). We then proceeded to analyse organoids derived from single AVIL+iRFP+cells (Fig.3eand Extended Data Fig.7m,n). These fully iRFP-labelled organoids contained all main intestinal epithelial lineages, including CHGA-expressing EECs (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.7o). Thus, in agreement with the organoid-forming potential of single tuft cells shown above, AVIL+cells have stem cell-like properties.

*** We found genes associated with intestinal stem cells to be highly expressed by tuft cells. These includedASCL2,BMI1andSOX4, but notOLFM4andLGR5(ref.32) (Extended Data Fig.8a,b). A few stem cell-associated genes, such asSMOC2andTACSTD2, were upregulated following IL-4 and IL-13 exposure, and were indeed upregulated in tuft-3/tuft-4 states. Furthermore, organoid-derived tuft cells expressed genes previously associated with fetal gut-like stem cells, facultative stem cells or revival stem cells, includingTACSTD2,MEX3A,PROX1andANXA1(refs.12,15,16), of which the last two were also expressed in primary tissue (Extended Data Fig.8a,b), suggesting a role for tuft cells in epithelial renewal following mechanical injury or other insults.

*** Mechanical passaging of organoids as a model to induce stress and damage did not show differences in organoid outgrowth dynamics or size between wild-type- andPOU2F3-deficient organoids (Fig.4a). However, mechanical disruption of differentiated organoids, followed by expansion, showed a diminished expansion potential inPOU2F3−/−compared to WT organoids (Fig.4b). These findings suggested a compromised regenerative capacity in organoids that lack tuft cells. To substantiate these observations, we transfected organoids with a doxycycline-inducible construct that ectopically expressesPOU2F3under the control of a viral promoter. Indeed, ectopicPOU2F3expression resulted in a higher frequency of KIT+cells and high expression of tuft cell-related genes following differentiation, and triggered enhanced organoid area as compared to control after mechanical disruption (Extended Data Fig.8c–e). Fast-cycling cells, including stem cells, are vulnerable to irradiation damage. Hence, we irradiated differentiated organoids (5–6 Gy), followed by a 2-day IL-4 and IL-13 pulse (and a non-pulsed control), after which the organoids were allowed to expand (Fig.4c). After an expansion phase of 2 weeks,POU2F3−/−organoids gradually lost their potential to passage or expand (Fig.4d). Wild-type organoids recovered from differentiation and irradiation, and this effect was stronger in organoids that had been exposed to IL-4 and IL-13 (Fig.4e,f). To further explore whether tuft cells have a major role in reconstitution following injury, we irradiated organoids harbouring the AVIL lineage-tracing construct (Fig.4gand Extended Data Fig.8f,g). After a recovery period of 9 days, we detected iRFP labelling of entire organoid segments, as well as an overall increase in labelled cell frequency, further confirming the regenerative capacity of tuft cells in these settings (Fig.4h,i).

*** Epithelial renewal depends on the presence of growth factors. Our transcriptional analysis showed an IL-4- and IL-13-induced upregulation of epiregulin (EREG), and—to a lower extent—amphiregulin (AREG) and heparin binding EGF (HBEGF) in tuft-3 and tuft-4 cells (Extended Data Fig.8a,h). The relevance of these growth factors in the context of injury-induced epithelial regeneration was confirmed by examining irradiated organoids engineered to lackEREG(Extended Data Fig.8i–k). Conversely, recombinant EREG supplementation to differentiatedPOU2F3−/−organoids partly restored organoid formation (Extended Data Fig.8l–n). Thus, these experiments indicated that tuft cells respond to the wound-repair-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 by a rapid proliferative response and the production of growth factors, whereas the concomitant dedifferentiation unleashes their reserve stem cell function.

*** The observed stem cell-like transcriptional profile and regenerative properties of adult tuft cells raised the question of whether tuft cells in developing intestines contribute to intestinal formation. On direct comparison to adult intestinal tissue, fetal human intestines showed an increased frequency of KIT+cells (Extended Data Fig.9a). Fetal KIT+cells showed a tuft cell signature on par with adult and paediatric intestinal tuft cells as determined by single-cell sequencing, and did not express higher levels of genes associated with a stem cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig.9b–d). Similarly, histological analysis using an antibody against AVIL confirmed the characteristic tuft cell shape (Extended Data Fig.9e), and revealed their scattered presence throughout the villus and intervillous zones (Extended Data Fig.9f). Cell sorting and subsequent culturing of KIT+and KIT−cells from primary fetal intestinal specimen confirmed that these fetal tuft-like cells showed potent organoid-forming potential, by comparison to non-tuft cells (Extended Data Fig.9g–i). The presence of tuft cells in fetal tissues suggest that these cells may be involved in the expansion of the intestinal epithelium during the fetal stages.

*** Regenerative responses are frequently accompanied by increased IL-4 and IL-13 levels33. Mouse tuft cell numbers are known to be controlled by these cytokines2,3,4. The current study shows four human tuft cell states, with differential functions. All four states maintain a shared core tuft cell gene-expression profile. Previously reported reserve and/or revival stem cells in mice16,17,34have many features in common with tuft cells described here: human tuft cells express markers linked to these previously reported facultative stem cells, such asTACSTD2,ANXA1,BMI1andCLU. This notion is further supported by a reinterpretation of early studies in mice that have linked DCLK1-expressing cells, a then unappreciated murine tuft cell marker, to proliferation in the context of a putative cancer-inducing stem cell population35,36. Indeed, in a study using a BAC-DCLK1::CreERT–dependent strategy to lineage-trace DCLK1-positive cells, it was observed that a small subset of DCLK1+cells could contribute to tissue regeneration after damage as assessed by lineage tracing in vivo. In the same study, it was shown that DCLK1+cells could grow out in short-term three-dimensional culture, expanding over a 1–2-week period37. From the perspective of the current study, we would interpret these combined data to indicate an evolutionary conserved capacity of tuft cells to act as reserve and/or revival stem cells in the context of intestinal injury.

*** Taken together, the observations in this study may have implications for regenerative medicine, opening up strategies for therapeutic interventions involving interleukins such as IL-4 and IL-13. Although the current study is focused on the intestinal tract, tuft cells are widely present in other endoderm-derived tissues38. It would be of interest to study the potential regenerative roles of tuft cells in tissues, such as the bile ducts, urinary tract and airways.

*** Uninflamed ileum, duodenum and colon were obtained from patients undergoing tumour-resection surgery; tissues were collected at an appropriate distance from the tumour. The resection specimen was obtained as residual material after clinical procedures in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the ethical guidelines of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, and Amsterdam University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All adult tissue material used in this study was obtained after informed consent, and with approval of tissue-specific protocols by the Medical Ethical Committee of the respective University Medical Centers.

*** Human fetal tissue was obtained from elective abortions at the Stichting Bloemenhove clinic in Heemstede, the Netherlands, on on the receipt of informed consent. The use of human abortion tissues was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Gestational age, determined by ultrasonic measurement of the diameter of the skull or femur, ranged from 19 to 21 weeks.

*** Human intestinal cells were isolated, processed and cultured as previously described39,40. Organoids were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination and resulted negative. The details of organoid donors used in each experiment are listed in Supplementary Table1.

*** Human intestinal organoids were split once a week by mechanic dissociation. In this study, basic culture medium includes advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 100 U ml−1penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 1× Glutamax (Gibco), 1× B-27 Supplement (Life Technologies), 1.25 mMN-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (v/v) recombinant Noggin (U-Protein Express).

*** Organoids were expanded in human expansion medium as previously described39. For differentiation towards tuft cells, organoids were washed 30 min in DMEM+++ at day 4 and the medium was replaced for tuft cell differentiation medium (diff): 0.5 nM Wnt surrogate (U-Protein Express), 20% (v/v) R-spondin1 (conditioned medium), 50 ng ml−1recombinant human EGF (Peprotech), 10 μM Notch inhibitor DAPT (Sigma-Aldrich) in basic culture medium. For tuft cell differentiation with IL-4 and IL-13, EGF was withdrawn, 5 ng ml−1human IL-4 (Peprotech) and 5 ng ml−1human IL-13 (Peprotech) were supplemented to tuft cell differentiation medium. BMP activation was achieved by withdrawing Noggin and addition of 50 ng ml−1BMP2 (Peprotech) and 50 ng ml−1BMP4 (Peprotech). Mature enterocytes and Paneth cell differentiation was achieved by using EGF, R-spondin1, BMP2/4 (ERB medium)41or 10 ng ml−1human IL-22 (Peprotech) in WENRA42(Wnt/R-spondin1, EGF, Noggin, ALK4,5,7 inhibitor (A83-01, Tocris)) medium, respectively. For specific experiments, 10 ng ml−1human IL-27 (Peprotech), 10 ng ml−1human IL-25 (Peprotech), 10 ng ml−1human SCF (Peprotech), 50 ng ml−1recombinant human Epiregulin (Peprotech), were used.

*** For organoid outgrowth experiments (Fig.3aand Extended Data Fig.6a–d), 100 single cells per 10 μl of basement membrane extract (BME) were seeded, and replated at day 3, keeping similar seeding density between tuft cell and non-tuft cell conditions.

*** For irradiation experiments, culture plates were sealed air-tight and irradiated with a single fraction of 5–6 Gy (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.8j–k)using a linear accelerator (Elekta Precise Linear Accelerator 11F49, Elekta). The plates were positioned on top of 2 cm-thick polystyrene and submerged in a 37 °C water bath and radiated from below with the plate being positioned at exactly 100 cm from the radiation source.

*** For irradiation of AVIL lineage tracing organoids (Fig.4g–i), organoids were differentiated for 4 days in tuft cell differentiation medium with IL-4 and IL-13, exposed to 1 μM Tamoxifen for 20 h, then the organoids were split and irradiated (9 Gy) 1 day after splitting.

*** For reporters, for generation reporter organoids using a CRISPR–HOT approach as described in ref.21, human duodenum, ileum and colon organoids were dissociated into small clumps, washed twice with Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher scientific) and resuspended in BTXpress solution (BTX). Clumps were resuspended with a targeting plasmid containing a fluorescent protein (Clover, mNeon or tdTomato), which can be linearized at a defined base position by a specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 (provided from a second plasmid, frame selector plasmid that also encodes mCherry). These two plasmids were co-electroporated with a plasmid encoding the sgRNA for the gene locus (Supplementary Table2, Addgene nos. 47108, 66939, 66940, 138569, 174092). Following blasticidin selection or cell sorting based on mCherry signal, clones were picked and successful incorporation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen).

*** Regarding knock-outs, for generation knock-out organoid lines using base-editing or conventional CRISPR–Cas9, spacer sequences for sgRNAs were cloned as previously described in the empty sgRNA backbone that was a kind gift from K. Joung (BPK1520, Addgene no. 65777)28. In short, plasmids were amplified using -inverse PCR (Q5, NEB), using primers with overhangs containing spacer sequences. PCR amplicons were subsequently ligated using T4 ligase (NEB) in a reaction with DpnI (NEB) to remove PCR template material. Ligations were transformed into MACH1T1 cells (Thermo Fisher) and sgRNA identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. For electroporation, 2.5 μg sgRNA plasmid (BPK1520, Addgene no. 65777), 7.5 μg pCMV_AncBE4max_P2A_GFP plasmid (for base-editing, Addgene no. 112100) or pCAS9-mCherry-Frame +1 plasmid (for conventional CRISPR–Cas9, Addgene no. 66940), together with 10 μg PiggyBac transposon system (5 μg transposase + 5 μg hygromycin resistance containing transposon)43were co-electroporated into human duodenum, ileum and colon AVIL-Clover reporter organoids. TheATOH1−/−line was generated in human ileum wild-type organoids. After hygromycin selection, subclones were genotyped. Knock-out clones were further expanded for the following experiments. The list of guide RNAs (gRNAs) and primers to genotype can be found in Supplementary Table2.

*** For FUCCI and overexpression constructs, for generation of the FUCCI reporter,ATOH1overexpression and H2B-iRFP in human ileum AVIL-Clover reporter organoids using transposon system, constructs were cloned into a p2T-based vector44using Gibson Assembly (NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly). The FUCCI sequence comprising mCherry-Cdt1-T2A-Geminin-hmAzami-Green was PCR-amplified from a construct provided as a kind gift by G. Kops (Hubrecht institute, Utrecht). The ATOH1-P2A-iRFP670 overexpression plasmid was cloned using a three-insert Gibson reaction. ATOH1 complementary DNA (IDT) was first cloned into a backbone vector with GSlinker-P2A-iRFP670, and the complete fragment of ATOH1-GSlinker-P2A-iRFP670-SV40polyA was amplified. The DNA fragment of tight TRE promoter with the ATG start codon and 3XFLAG tag was amplified from pCW-Cas9 (Addgene no. 50661). The DNA fragment of hPGK-PuroR-rTetR was amplified from pCW-Cas9. All three DNA fragments were then cloned in the digested backbone. For continuous expression H2B-iRFP670, the H2B-iRFP670 and IRES-Puromycin sequences were PCR-amplified, respectively, then were inserted into the p2T vector cut with NheI (Promega) and SmaI (Promega). Organoid lines were generated by co-electroporation of 5 µg of the respective FUCCI,ATOH1-P2A-iRFP670 or H2B-iRFP670 expression construct together with 5 µg of mT2TP transposase mediating the tol2-dependent random integration of the expression constructs into the cell genome.

*** For generationPOU2F3overexpression in human duodenum, colon organoids using lentivirus system, a gBlock forPOU2F3was ordered from IDT, which contained a 5′ untranslated region sequence, including an EcoRI site and a Kozak sequence, and 3′ tag sequence instead of the STOP codon, which includes a Gly linker, HA tag, P2A sequence and another EcoRI site. This gBlock was cloned into a pJet vector and an EcoRI restriction enzyme cloning step was done to introduce thePOU2F3sequence into pLX vector, which enable the doxycycline-inducedPOU2F3-P2A-tdTomato expression31. Organoids were lentivirally transduced as previously described45.

*** For lineage tracing, human ileum organoids were targeted with a tdTomato and CreERT2 sequence fused with the gene encoding for Advillin using a CRISPR–HOT approach as described in ref.21(tdTomato-T2A-CreERT2 to theAVILlocus separated by a P2A sequence to obtain AVIL-P2A-tdTomato-T2A-CreERT2). In parallel, using mT2TP transposase-based random integration, a CAG promoter-driven loxp-flanked puromycin resistance containing a stop codon with a downstream H2B-iRFP670 was introduced (CAG-loxp-puromycin-stop-loxp-H2B-iRFP670).

*** Organoids were chemically fixed for 3 h at room temperature with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.067 M cacodylate buffered to pH 7.4 and 1% sucrose. Samples were washed once with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4), 1% sucrose and three times with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4), followed by incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. After rinsing with Milli-Q water, organoids were dehydrated at room temperature in a graded ethanol series (70, 90, up to 100%) and embedded in Epon polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections of 60 nm were cut using a diamond knife (Diatome) on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome, and transferred onto 50 Mesh copper grids covered with a Formvar and carbon film. Sections were poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

*** All transmission electron microscopy images were collected autonomously using a virtual nanoscopy slide46on a Tecnai T12 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 120 kV using an Eagle camera. Data were stitched, uploaded, shared and annotated using Omero v.5.6.x and PathViewer v.3.7. The final pictures were directly acquired at the microscope in a manual standard way, using the Eagle camera at 4,000 × 4,000.

*** Organoid RNA was isolated using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR analysis using Bio-Rad CFX Manager v.3.1 and Microsoft Excel was used to perform biological and technical replicates as previously described47. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table3.

*** Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE (TrypLE Express, Life Technologies) with 10 μM Rho kinase inhibitor (Abmole) in 37 °C and mechanical disruption by pipetting every 5 min. Cells were stained for 30 min with antibody, then were visualized using a BD LSR Fortessa X20 4 laser (BD Biosciences, FACSDiva v.9.0) or sorted using BD FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) Influx (BD Biosciences, v.1.2.0.142) based on fluorescence levels. FlowJo software (v.10.6.2) was used to analyse the flow cytometry data. For scRNA-seq, single cells were sorted on FACSFusion (BD Biosciences, FACSDiva v.8.0.1) and collected in 384-well plates with ERCC spike-ins (Agilent), reverse transcription primers and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (both Promega). Single-cell sequencing was performed according to the Sort-seq method48.

*** For organoids staining, PE antihuman CD117 antibody (KIT; 1:100, Biolegend, 313204) or Biotin antihuman CD117 (1:100, Biolegend, 313208) and Brilliant Violet 421 Streptavidin (1:1,000, Biolegend, 405226), LIVE/DEAD Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher, L34974) were used in some experiments. For sorting from primary human fetal and adult intestine tissue, Alexa Fluor 488 antihuman CD326 (Epcam; 1:100, Biolegend, 324210), APC/Cy7 antihuman CD45 (1:100, Biolegend, 304014), PE antihuman CD117 antibody (KIT; 1:100, Biolegend, 313204) were used. For cell multiplexing oligo labelling, organoids were digested into single cells using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher), washed three times with ice-cold PBS + 10% FBS and incubated 15 min at room temperature with 100 μl Cell Multiplexing Oligo. After washing, 8,000 live cells (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole negative (DAPI−) cells) per condition were sorted into collection tube, were subjected to droplet-based scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform.

*** For immunostainings, sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human colon and ileum tissue were obtained from resections performed at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Anonymized archival pathology material was used according to the guidelines of the University Medical Center Utrecht’s Research Ethics Committee49. The human intestine tissues were fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained as described previously50. Rabbit anti-Advillin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, HPA058864), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:4,000, monosan, MONX10283), rabbit antichromogranin A (1:600, labned.com, LN1401487) followed by goat antirabbit (ready to use, Immunologic, DPVR110HRP) or EnVision kits antimouse (ready to use, Dako, K4001) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and then visualized (VS200 slide scanner, software v.VS200 ASW 3.3, Olympus-Lifescience).

*** Whole-mount staining of organoids was performed as previously described51. In brief, organoids were removed from the BME, then were fixed 2 h at room temperature in formalin. Next, the organoids were permeabilized using 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for at least 15 min and blocked for at least 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 g l−1bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-AVIL (1:300, Sigma-Aldrich, HPA058864), rabbit anti-POU2F3 (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019652), goat anti-GFP (1:600, Abcam, ab6673), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:100, BD Pharminge, 550609), rabbit antichromogranin A (1:100, labned.com, LN1401487), rabbit antimucin 2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15334), rabbit anti-APOB (1:100, Novus Biologicals, NBP2-38608), rabbit anti-Lysozyme antibody (1:100, GeneTex, GTX72913), rabbit anti-Vimentin (1:100, Cell Signaling technology, 5741S), mouse anti-TM4SF4 antibody (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, sc-293348), APC Mouse antihuman CD274 (1:100, BD Pharmingen, 563741), goat anti-GNAT3 (1:100 in organoids, LSBio, LS-B4942), goat anti-GNAT3 (1:500 in human intestine tissue slides, OAEB00418, Aviva Systems Biology), rabbit anti-CD117 (c-kit, 1:100, DAKO, A4502). Organoids were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A12379) or phalloidin-atto647N (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich, 65906), with the corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 405 donkey antirabbit (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A48258), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey antimouse (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21202), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey antigoat (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11055), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey antirabbit (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific A10042), Alexa Fluor 647 goat antimouse (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21236), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey antirabbit (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A31573) and DyLight 755 donkey antirabbit (1:1,000, Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, SA5-10043) in blocking buffer containing DAPI (1:1,000, Invitrogen, D1306). Sections were embedded in fructose–glycerol clearing solution, then visualized on Leica SP8 confocal microscope (LAS X v.1.1). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (Fiji, v.1.51n) and Imaris (Andor Technology, v.x64 9.3.1) software.

*** Some images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with Airyscan (Carl Zeiss, software version ZEN 2) and a LCI Plan-Neofluar ×63 numerical aperture (NA) 1.3 water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss) at a voxel resolution of 0.04 µm (x/y) to 0.19 µm (z). Images were deconvoluted using the Zen Black (Carl Zeiss)-inbuild Airyscan postprocessing module. Images were processed (Gauss filtering) using Fiji and rendered in Imaris.

*** STED super resolution microscopy was performed using a Leica STELLARIS 8 STED microscope (software v.4.7.0.28176) using a HC PL APO CS2 ×100 NA 1.40 oil objective. Organoids expressing AVIL-Clover were fixed, stained with DAPI and phalloidin-atto647N and mounted on 0.16–0.19-mm-thick cover glasses (Glaswarenfabrik Karl Hecht GmbH & Co KG) in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tuft cell reporter and DAPI signal were recorded with confocal resolution and tuft cells identified. The actin cytoskeleton was visualized with super resolution microscopy with a pixel resolution of 10 × 10 nm. To do so, phalloidin-atto647N was illuminated with 647 nm excitation and 775 depletion lasers. The signal was recorded with a line averaging of 16, a dwell time of 0.69 µs.

*** For clustering analysis, the surface of organoids in three-dimensional image stacks was projected into two dimensions using the LocalZProjector Fiji plugin based on DAPI-stained nuclei and tuft cells were segmented using the ITK-SNAP software (v.3.8.0). For the clustering analysis, a custom-made MATLAB script was used. Inter-tuft cell distance was measured based on the Euclidean distance of their centroid position and expressed as a multiple of the average cell distance. A density map was computed, and a contour plot was generated using the imcontour function. Clusters were identified within an eight-cell-distance and analysed using the MATLAB package ‘Distance-based clustering of a set ofxycoordinates’ (Y. Marcon (2023),https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56150-distance-based-clustering-of-a-set-of-xy-coordinates), made available through the MATLAB Central File Exchange.

*** Live imaging experiments were performed on a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Argon laser and White Light Laser at 37 °C and 5% CO2using a Leica ×20 NA 0.7 air objective. Images were acquired in a line-sequential mode separating the fluorophore recordings with minimal spectral overlap with a final pixel resolution of 1.65 pixels per micrometre, an axial resolution of 1.4 µm and a time interval of 9 min.

*** Long-term live imaging was performed using a LS1 Live light sheet microscope (Viventis Microscopy, software v.2.0.0.3) using a Nikon ×25 NA 1.1 water immersion objective at a magnification of ×18. Organoids were mounted on a single-chamber sample holder 1 day before the start of imaging. A position-specific alignment of the light sheets with a thickness of 2.2 µm was done. The samples were imaged with a 488 and 561 nm illumination to visualize Clover- and tdTomato-based reporters with a time interval of 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

*** The postacquisitional analysis was done with custom-made Fiji script, the H.264 encoding was done using HandBrake (v.1.8.1) software.

*** scRNA-seq libraries of organoid-derived material, and KIT+enriched cells from fetal and adult intestines were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform, at a median sequencing depth of 49,861 reads per cell. Reads were mapped to a human genome (hg38) integrated with the Clover transcript using STAR (v.2.7.8a), reads with many mapping positions were excluded. Reads were associated with genes if they were mapped to an exon. Reads were demultiplexed and collapsed into unique molecular identifier (UMI) tables using umi_tools (v.1.1.1) allowing up to one hamming distance of the cell barcode. Cells with less than 500 UMI or with more than 40% mitochondrial genes were excluded from analysis.

*** All analysis was performed in R. We used the MetaCell package (v.0.3.5)26to analyse all scRNA-seq data collected in this study. Default parameters were used unless otherwise stated. We derived a MetaCell cover of DAPI−/AVIL-Clover+and DAPI−epithelial cells from human ileal organoids. Mitochondrial genes and the highly variable immunoglobulin genes (IGH, IGK and IGL prefixes) were removed from the UMI tables. Gene features for MetaCell covers were selected using the parameter Tvm=0.1, total umi more than ten and more than three UMI in at least three cells. We filtered the list of gene features used for MetaCell analysis from genes associated with cell cycle, immediate stress response and gene modules inducing strong patient-specific biases. To this end, we first identified all genes with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.13 for one of the anchor genesTOP2A,MKI67,PCNA,MCM4,UBE2C,STMN1,FOS,EGR1,IER3,FOSB,HSPA1B,HSPA1A,HSP90AA1andDNAJB1. We then hierarchically clustered the correlation matrix between these genes (filtering genes with low coverage and computing correlation using a down-sampled UMI matrix) and selected the gene clusters that contained the above anchor genes. We thus retained 94 genes as features. We used MetaCell to build ak-nearest neighbours graph, perform boot-strapped coclustering (500 iterations; resampling 70% of the cells in each iteration) and derive a cover of the coclusteringk-nearest neighbours graph (k= 30). Outlier cells featuring a gene expression higher than fourfold than the geometric mean in the metacells in at least one gene were discarded. Detailed annotation of the different tuft and epithelial cell subsets was performed using hierarchical clustering of the MetaCell confusion matrix. ClusterProfiler52(v.3.14.0) and ChIPpeakAnno (v.3.20.0) were applied to perform gene functional annotation of DEGs.

*** scRNA-seq of passage 1 day 7 KIT−- and KIT+-derived organoids was performed using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ v.3.1 platform, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) and demultiplexed using cellranger (v.7.1.0). Recovered cellplex barcodes were used to assign single cells to experimental batches. Single cells with less than 64 UMI of a specific cellplex barcodes were discarded from downstream analysis. Single cells with less than eightfold UMI count ratio between highest and second highest cellplex barcodes were marked as doublets and discarded from downstream analysis. Single cells with less than 1,000 genomic UMIs or more than 20% mitochondrial content failed to pass quality control and were discarded from further analysis, resulting in 10,311 quality control-positive cells.

*** Clustering of passage 1 KIT−- and KIT+-derived organoids was performed as stated above. Gene features for the MetaCell covers were selected using the parameter Tvm=0.1, total umi>15 and more than three UMI in at least three cells, resulting in 228 features.

*** We reanalysed scRNA-seq data from human primary intestinal tissue18. We selected 15,184 single cells from healthy adult small intestine, with more than 1,000 and less than 20,000 total UMI for further analysis. Cells were analysed with the MetaCell package as previously described to derive a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the data for Extended Data Figs.3aand5b. Otherwise, we used predefined annotations to epithelial cell types. In Extended Data Figs.3jand5fwe sampled 500 cells from each cell types out of the total 77,364 healthy adult single cells in that database.

*** No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. All experiments were performed in several distinct replicates, as indicated in the text and figure legends. Organoids analysed were chosen randomly. All statistical tests were two-tailed, except in Fig.1b,dand Extended Data Fig.1f, where different growth conditions were assessed for increased tuft cell numbers. We used Student’st-test for continuous data and Mann–Whitney test for discrete data, and used FDR adjustment to correct for many hypotheses.
