*** Futuristic technologies such as morphing aircrafts and super-strong artificial muscles depend on metal alloys being as strong as ultrahigh-strength steel yet as flexible as a polymer1,2,3. However, achieving such ‘strong yet flexible’ alloys has proven challenging4,5,6,7,8,9because of the inevitable trade-off between strength and flexibility5,8,10. Here we report a Ti–50.8 at.% Ni strain glass alloy showing a combination of ultrahigh yield strength ofσy≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus ofE≈ 10.5 GPa, together with super-large rubber-like elastic strain of approximately 8%. As a result, it possesses a high flexibility figure of merit ofσy/E≈ 0.17 compared with existing structural materials. In addition, it can maintain such properties over a wide temperature range of −80 °C to +80 °C and demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance at high strain. The alloy was fabricated by a simple three-step thermomechanical treatment that is scalable to industrial lines, which leads not only to ultrahigh strength because of deformation strengthening, but also to ultralow modulus by the formation of a unique ‘dual-seed strain glass’ microstructure, composed of a strain glass matrix embedded with a small number of aligned R and B19′ martensite ‘seeds’. In situ X-ray diffractometry shows that the polymer-like deformation behaviour of the alloy originates from a nucleation-free reversible transition between strain glass and R and B19′ martensite during loading and unloading. This exotic alloy with the potential for mass producibility may open a new horizon for many futuristic technologies, such as morphing aerospace vehicles, superman-type artificial muscles and artificial organs.

*** Exotic metal alloys showing steel-like ultrahigh strength and polymer-like ultrahigh flexibility simultaneously have long been desired for many emerging technologies such as morphing aircrafts1,2and superman-type artificial muscles3. Such an unconventional ‘strong yet flexible’ property combination (the red circle of Fig.1a) will enable a large recoverable shape change at low actuation cost and simultaneously provide strong resistance against fracture or yielding failure under large loads. As a result, such alloys would make possible a morphing wing in an aircraft or a super-strong artificial muscle in a humanoid robot, to name just a few possibilities.

*** a, The DS-STG alloy exhibits a combination of steel-like high strength and polymer-like ultralow Young’s modulus. This ‘strong yet flexible’ property overcomes the strength–flexibility trade-off (grey band, known as an Ashby plot4), which has rendered existing structural materials to be either ‘strong and stiff’ or ‘weak and flexible’.b, Rubber-like, J-shaped pseudoelastic stress–strain curves of the DS-STG alloy (plate and wire samples) compared with those of typical metal alloys (quenched 65Mn spring steel, Ti-6Al-4V ELI Ti alloy, 7021-T62 Al alloy and AZ91D Mg alloy) and organic materials (bamboo, FRP, PEEK and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)) within their elasticity limit. The dotted lines represent the plastic deformation behaviour of each material beyond the elasticity limit. The higher yield strength of the wire sample (1.8 GPa) compared with the plate sample (1.3 GPa) arises from the stronger cold deformation experienced in the former (seeMethodsfor details). The reproducibility of the result and statistical analysis of the data are presented in Extended Data Fig.1.c, The flexibility figure of meritσy/Eof DS-STG alloys far exceeds that of existing structural materials. Young’s modulus is determined by the initial slope of the stress–strain curve (inset).d, Visual evidence for the unconventional strong yet flexible property of the DS-STG alloy, which contrasts with that of two conventional materials, one being a strong and stiff spring steel and the other being a weak and flexible FRP with Young’s modulus of 11 GPa. See also Supplementary Video1. A visual comparison of the flexibility up to the elastic limit for these three materials is given in Extended Data Fig.2and Supplementary Video2.

*** However, achieving such unconventional alloys has remained challenging because of the inevitable trade-off between strength and flexibility (the latter being measured by elastic compliance or inverse of elastic modulus)5,8,10, as manifested by the grey band (known as the Ashby plot4) in Fig.1a. The figure reveals a common observation4,10,11that steels can be made very strong (with a high yield strengthσy> 1 GPa) but they are stiff (with high Young’s modulusE≈ 200 GPa), whereas organic materials such as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) have the opposite property of being flexible (with a typical lowE≈ 10 GPa) but weak (σy< 0.3 GPa). The strength–flexibility trade-off stems from the fact that the two properties are oppositely correlated to the bonding strength of a material, which is represented roughly by the elastic modulus5,8,10. Therefore, this inevitable trade-off precludes a 1 GPa-class, steel-like, high-strength alloy from having a 10 GPa-class, polymer-like, low modulus.

*** Over the past decades, significant efforts have been made to seek metal alloys with simultaneously high strength and low modulus4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17, but an alloy showing both steel-like high yield strength (σy> 1 GPa) and polymer-like low modulus (E≈ 10 GPa) still remains unattainable. So far, several alloys based on shape memory alloys (SMAs)5,16,17have been reported with a 1 GPa-class high strength and a moderately low modulus ofE≈ 30 GPa, and a conventional Mg–Sc strain glass alloy7has recently been shown to possess a lower modulus ofE≈ 20 GPa but with a lower strength ofσy≈ 0.3 GPa. Despite these efforts, existing alloys still fall into the conventional grey band of Fig.1a, and the desired polymer-like ultrahigh-strength property (the red circle of Fig.1a) still remains elusive.

*** Here we show that a Ti–50.8 at.% Ni dual-seed strain glass (DS-STG) alloy can overcome the strength–flexibility trade-off and demonstrate simultaneously a steel-like ultrahigh yield strength ofσy≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow Young’s modulus ofE≈ 10.5 GPa (Fig.1a), together with a super-large, rubber-like, J-shaped elastic strain of around 8% (Fig.1b). As a result, it exhibits a flexibility figure of merit ofσy/E≈ 0.17, which is very high compared with that of existing structural materials (Fig.1c), and the alloy behaves like a super-strong polymer (Fig.1d). In addition, the polymer-like ultrahigh-strength behaviour can persist over a wide ambient temperature range from 193 K (−80 °C) to 353 K (+80 °C) (Fig.2a), which would enable its application in aerospace technologies, and the alloy demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance compared with other flexible materials (Fig.2b).

*** a, Temperature dependence of elastic modulus and yield strength over a wide temperature range from 123 K to 423 K, in which the polymer-like ultrahigh-strength behaviour of the DS-STG alloy can persist from 193 K to 353 K. The stress–strain curves of the DS-STG at various temperatures are shown in the insets. The shallow U-shaped dependence of Young’s modulus on temperature is a characteristic feature of all strain glasses, with the modulus bottom temperatureTgbeing the strain glass transition temperature (hereTg≈ 280 K). The U-shaped dependence originates from the parent lattice softening atT>Tg, and the gradual dominance of elastically hardened STG nanodomains whenT<Tg(ref.34). The combination of stable ultrahigh yield strength and shallow U-shaped low modulus results in a broad peak in the flexibility figure of meritσy/Ewith a peak value of approximately 0.17 around room temperature, and it maintains a high value exceeding 0.06 over a wide temperature range of around 125–400 K, as shown in Extended Data Fig.3.b, Excellent high-strain (more than 1.5%) fatigue resistance of the DS-STG compared with conventional flexible materials, including TiNi SMAs and engineering polymers such as PEEK and FRP. The upper left inset shows a comparison of the strain–life fatigue curves at a high-strain level (that is, maximum fatigue strain >1.5%) for the DS-STG and existing metal alloys (including TiNi SMAs and conventional metal alloys) and engineering polymers. The upper right inset shows that the DS-STG alloy does not fatigue even up to 5 million cycles at a sizable cyclic strain of around 1.6–1.8%. High-strain fatigue is defined by a fatigue test with the maximum cyclic strainεm> 1.5%, and the corresponding maximum stress isσm. The data source in the figure is given in theSupplementary Information.

*** In the following, we first demonstrate the unique mechanical properties of the alloy, then show the three-step thermomechanical fabrication route towards its unique DS-STG microstructure and finally discuss the origin of the mechanical properties in relation to the DS-STG microstructure.

*** Figure1ashows that the DS-STG alloy overcomes the well-observed strength–flexibility trade-off of existing structural materials (shown as the grey band of Fig.1a) and exhibits a combination of steel-like ultrahigh yield strength ofσy≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow Young’s modulusE≈ 10.5 GPa (corresponding to ultrahigh elastic compliance ofS=1/E≈ 0.1 GPa−1). Such a property combination places the DS-STG alloy into the ‘strong yet flexible’ regime (the red circle in Fig.1a).

*** Figure1bshows that the DS-STG alloy demonstrates a rubber-like, J-shaped stress–strain curve with an ultralow initial modulusE≈ 10.5 GPa and a super-large recoverable strainεre≈ 8%, before reaching its elasticity limit atσy≈ 1.8 GPa for the wire sample andσy≈ 1.3 GPa for the plate sample. Also the loading–unloading curves have a narrow hysteresis of only around 15%. It is noted that the 1.8 GPa (or 1.3 GPa) yield strength of DS-STG alloy exceeds that of ultrahigh-strength steels such as quenched spring steel, and the 8% pseudoelastic strain not only far exceeds the small elastic strainεre≈ 0.2–1% for typical metal alloys18,19,20but also surpasses that (εre≈ 1–5%) of many soft organic structural materials, such as wood, bamboo, bones, polymer and FRP21,22,23,24. The large J-shaped pseudoelasticity behaviour associated with a narrow stress hysteresis resembles that of ultra-flexible materials such as rubbers25, and it is very different from the superelasticity of conventional SMAs, which is characterized by a stress plateau with a much higher initial modulus ofE≈ 30–75 GPa and a large hysteresis (approximately 50–90%)26,27,28. The strongly hysteretic behaviour of SMAs is known to be undesirable for many applications28,29,30.

*** The combination of ultrahigh strength and ultralow modulus provides the DS-STG alloy with a super-high flexibility figure of merit ofσy/E≈ 0.17, which is much higher than that of existing structural materials including typical metal alloys and organic materials, as shown in Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.3. The flexibility figure of meritσy/Eis a measure of ultimate material flexibility before yielding failure10, and existing structural materials usually have a lowerσy/E≈ 0.01–0.06.

*** Figure1dand Supplementary Video1show visual evidence for the unconventional strong yet flexible property of the DS-STG alloy, which contrasts with the conventional behaviour of two reference materials: a ‘strong and stiff’ spring steel (with high modulusE≈ 190 GPa and high strengthσy≈ 1.36 GPa) and a ‘weak and flexible’ FRP (with low modulusE≈ 11 GPa and low strengthσy≈ 0.13 GPa). Thus, the DS-STG alloy combines the high strength of a steel with the high flexibility of a polymer, and it behaves like a super-strong organic material, which has long been desired by many emerging technologies.

*** The polymer-like ultrahigh-strength behaviour of DS-STG alloy can persist over a wide temperature range from 193 K (−80 °C) to 353 K (80 °C) (Fig.2a), which covers the aviation ambient temperature range (−80 °C to 70 °C)31that a morphing aircraft is expected to experience. Over this wide temperature range, Young’s modulus maintains a polymer-like ultralow level of 10 to 16 GPa, which is similar to its room-temperature value of 10.5 GPa; moreover, the yield strength maintains its ultrahigh-strength level of 1.8 GPa. The recoverable strain also maintains a high value above 6.3% over this wide temperature range.

*** The DS-STG alloy exhibits excellent high-strain (defined by a maximum cyclic strain exceeding 1.5%) fatigue resistance as compared with other flexible materials, such as conventional TiNi SMAs and engineering polymers (for example, polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and FRP4) (Fig.2band upper left inset), which are candidate materials for morphing airplanes and artificial muscle fibres in which high-strain cyclic deformation is common. The upper right inset of Fig.2bshows that the DS-STG alloy demonstrates a notable fatigue-free behaviour (with fatigue life of more than 5×106cycles) at a sizable strain of 1.6%, which is high compared with existing metal alloys including SMAs and exceeds that of engineering polymers. Such a level of fatigue-free strain would meet the requirement of morphing wings to produce a sufficiently large camber shape change (of more than 6%)32.

*** The DS-STG alloy was fabricated through a three-step thermomechanical processing route from a starting solution-treated Ti–50.8 at.%Ni alloy, as shown in Fig.3a. The simplicity of this processing method makes it scalable to industrial lines. The corresponding microstructure after each step is described below.

*** a, Processing route and the corresponding phase state after each step. The microstructure of the starting B2 parent phase (an unfrozen strain glass) is shown in Extended Data Fig.4a, and that of the deformation-stabilized B19′ martensite obtained after step 1 processing is shown in Extended Data Fig.4b.b, After step 2 processing, the sample becomes a DC-STG, an unfrozen R-STG at room temperature that first undergoes a strain glass transition into a frozen strain glass aroundTg≈ 251 K, followed by crossover transitions into R and B19′ dual martensites, as revealed by Vogel–Fulcher (V–F)-type frequency (ω)-dependentTg(ω) in the storage modulus in combination with in situ TEM and in situ XRD characterizations. Scale bars, main images, 50 nm; enlargements, 25 nm.c, After step 3 processing, the sample becomes a DS-STG, as revealed by the high-resolution TEM image (top) at room temperature. Scale bar, 10 nm. The DS-STG is characterized by aligned R and B19′ martensite seeds embedded in a DC-STG matrix. Noise-reduction processing of the image is shown in Extended Data Fig.6. The enlarged images (middle) show the lattice fringes of R-STG nanodomains with a lattice spacing of 3d110B2, or periodicityP= 3, R martensite seed (withP= 3) and B19′ martensite seed (withP= 2). Scale bars, 2 nm. A low-magnification bright-field image (bottom) of the DS-STG reveals high-density dislocations and B2 deformation twins (evidenced by the twin diffraction pattern shown in the inset). Scale bar, 100 nm.

*** The starting solution-treated Ti–50.8 at.%Ni alloy (Fig.3a(i)) is in its B2 parent state (strictly speaking an unfrozen strain glass state33,34,35(Extended Data Fig.4a)) at room temperature as it has a subzero martensitic transformation temperature ofMs≈ 250 K. Such a B2 state exhibits a high elastic modulus ofE≈ 71 GPa and an incomplete super-elasticity with a large remanent strain of 6% and a large stress hysteresis of around 90% (Extended Data Fig.4a) during loading and unloading even at a moderate stress of approximately 0.3 GPa. This is a well-observed behaviour of TiNi alloys when dislocation slip occurs during a stress-induced martensitic transformation14. Thus, the starting B2 alloy is neither a strong alloy nor a polymer-like alloy.

*** In step 1 processing, the B2 alloy is severely deformed by 50% tensile elongation (Fig.3a(ii)). This cold-working process results in a deformation-stabilized B19′ martensite, which is preserved at room temperature (Extended Data Fig.4b). The cold-working-strengthened B19′ martensite shows a quasilinear elastic behaviour with a high yield stress of around 1.3 GPa and a moderate elastic modulus ofE≈ 37 GPa, as shown in Extended Data Fig.4b. Such mechanical properties are consistent with previous reports on tensile-deformed TiNi alloys12,36; thus, the deformation-stabilized B19′ martensite alloy is a high-strength alloy but not an ultralow-modulus alloy.

*** In step 2 processing (formation of a dual-crossover strain glass state), the deformation-stabilized B19′ martensite alloy is annealed or conditioned at 573 K for 10 min (Fig.3a(iii)). Annealing at such a temperature fully annihilates the metastable B19′ martensite produced in step 1 processing, but is unable to annihilate or recrystallize the high-density dislocations and B2 deformation twins (to be shown below). As a result, the sample seems to be like a ‘parent B2 phase’ with a high yield strength of approximately 1 GPa (Extended Data Fig.4c).

*** However, this parent B2 phase is actually a unique dual-crossover strain glass (DC-STG) with average B2 structure. The DC-STG is an unfrozen R strain glass (R-STG) at room temperature and it undergoes a strain glass transition aroundTg≈ 251 K. This is evidenced by the same signatures being shown as those of a normal strain glass transition reported in the literature33,34,35, including a frequency-dependentTgfollowing the Vogel–Fulcher law (inset of Fig.3b) and the invariance of average B2 structure acrossTg, together with the appearance of nano sized R strain domains (5–20 nm). However, being different from a conventional R-STG, which keeps R nanodomains down to 0 K, the DC-STG is able to crossover to R and B19′ dual martensites (50–100 nm in size) at lower temperatures, as evidenced by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Fig.3b). It is noted that the crossover transitions are incomplete and a significant amount of strain glass remains even at the lowest temperature tested. This unique R-STG that can cross over into R and B19′ dual martensites is thus named ‘dual-crossover strain glass’.

*** It should be noted that this DC-STG state, albeit a forerunner state to the ultralow-modulus DS-STG state, is not a low modulus state by itself. It shows a nonlinear and hysteretic super-elastic behaviour, with a moderate initial elastic modulus of around 33 GPa and a high yield strength of around 1 GPa (Extended Data Fig.4c).

*** In step 3 processing (formation of a DS-STG state; Extended Data Fig.5), the DC-STG alloy undergoes a moderate tensile elongation of approximately 12% (Fig.3a(iv)). This process introduces a small amount of aligned R and B19′ martensite dual seeds (50–100 nm in size) into the room-temperature DC-STG matrix (manifested as nanosized R domains), as revealed by a high-resolution TEM image (Fig.3c, top). The resultant strain glass state containing R and B19′ dual seeds is thus named ‘dual-seed strain glass’. Clearly, the realization of this unique DS-STG state is due to its forerunner state DC-STG being able to crossover into two martensites R and B19′, as revealed in Fig.3b. Such a unique DS-STG state gives this alloy a polymer-like ultralow modulus ofE≈ 10.5 GPa, together with a rubber-like, J-shaped, super-large recoverable strain ofεre≈ 8% and a narrow hysteresis of around 15% (Fig.1b). The mechanism of such unconventional elastic behaviour is shown in Fig.4.

*** In situ XRD profiles during loading (left) and unloading (right) from 0 GPa and 1.3 GPa. The variation of the volume fraction of the constituent phases with applied stress during loading and unloading is shown in the pie charts. A smooth transition from the STG (with R and B19′ seeds) to the R + B19′ mixture and then to B19′ martensite occurs during loading and a smooth reverse transition occurs during unloading. The smooth evolution of the R and B19′ peaks indicates that the transition can start at nearly zero stress and that there is no nucleation barrier associated with the transition. X-ray goniometry under tensile loading is illustrated in the top inset. The possibility of internal stress as the origin of the ultralow modulus of the DS-STG is excluded in the experiment shown in Extended Data Fig.7. a.u., arbitrary units.

*** The low-magnification image of the DS-STG alloy (Fig.3c, bottom) shows that it contains high-density dislocations and a large number of B2 mechanical twins, which are formed by the severe cold-working during the thermomechanical processing. These deformation-strengthening features are characteristic of severely deformed TiNi alloys16,37,38,39,40,41,42, and can account for the ultrahigh yield strength of the DS-STG alloy (Fig.1b).

*** To confirm the general applicability of the three-step thermomechanical processing in achieving polymer-like ultrahigh-strength properties, we also tested a wire sample of the Ti–50.8 at.%Ni alloy using the same three-step procedure, but the severe deformation of the sample (that is, step 1 processing) was done with a wire-drawing machine to produce a 50% area reduction instead of using a tensile machine to produce 50% elongation for the plate sample. As can be seen in Fig.1b, the wire sample shows the same ultralow modulus ofE≈ 10.5 GPa as that of the plate sample, but with an even higher yield strength ofσy≈ 1.8 GPa due to the stronger cold deformation associated with the 50% area reduction for the cold-drawn sample. Therefore, the present three-step processing route is applicable to both wire and plate samples with step 1 deformation being either tensile elongation or cold-drawing.

*** The in situ tensile XRD experiment (Fig.4) shows that the DS-STG alloy with the above microstructural feature (Fig.3c) undergoes a unique nucleation-free reversible transition between STG and R and B19′ martensites during a stress loading–unloading cycle up to 1.3 GPa. This process leads to the observed ultralow elastic modulus. Before loading (that is,σ= 0 GPa), the DS-STG appears as a DC-STG matrix embedded with a small fraction of aligned R and B19′ martensite seeds, as evidenced in the XRD profile by a broadened B2 peak (representing the average structure of the random STG nanodomains43) with a long asymmetrical tail covering R and B19′ high-angle peak positions only. With increasing stress, unlike the case in a normal stress-induced martensitic transformation in which the inevitable nucleation barrier requires a critical stress to induce martensite, in DS-STG the R and B19′ martensite peaks grow smoothly without needing a critical stress and the whole sample transforms almost fully into B19′ martensite atσ= 1.3 GPa. Clearly, this is a result of R and B19′ martensite seeds that bypass the nucleation barrier of the stress-induced transition, consequently leading to the polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus (E≈ 10.5 GPa). Upon unloading from 1.3 GPa, a smooth reverse transition occurs from B19′ to a mixture of R and B19′, and then to the original state of DS-STG. Thus, the original DS-STG state is recovered upon unloading. The large recoverable strain (εre≈ 8%) is a natural result of this reversible transformation for polycrystalline TiNi samples with some contribution from the elastic strain of martensite26.

*** Another important consequence of the nucleation-free DS-STG to R and B19′ transition is that it causes a J-shape and narrow hysteresis feature in the stress–strain curve of the DS-STG alloy, which arises from R and B19′ martensite seeds bypassing the nucleation barrier during a stress-induced transition. This results in an ultralow initial slope in the stress–strain curve, that is, the J-shape, and a narrow stress hysteresis of around 15%. The narrow hysteresis is also reflected by the similarity of the XRD profiles between loading and unloading at the same stress level. The smooth, J-shaped and narrow-hysteretic behaviour of DS-STG contrasts with that of the normal stress-induced STG to martensite transition (Extended Data Fig.4c) or a conventional stress-induced martensitic transformation (Extended Data Fig.4a), in which the inevitable nucleation leads not only to a much higher elastic modulus ofE≈ 30–70 GPa but also to a strongly nonlinear and hysteretic stress–strain behaviour with a stress plateau14,16.

*** Figure5ashows that a DS-STG state is essential to achieve a polymer-like ultralow modulus. Such a state is obtained by a three-step processing with step 2 annealing at a temperature ofTa≈ 573 K. When the step 2 annealing temperatureTadeviates from the optimal 573 K, the alloy deviates from a DS-STG state and this results in an increase in elastic modulus and a decrease in recoverable strain.

*** a, Young’s modulus and recoverable strain of the three-step processed Ti–50.8 at.%Ni alloy as a function of step 2 annealing temperatureTa. Polymer-like low modulus (E≈ 10.5 GPa) and maximum recoverable strain of 8% of the DS-STG state arise from its forerunner DC-STG state obtained atTa≈ 573 K.b, Phase diagram of annealed samples as a function of step 2 annealing temperatureTa, in which the DC-STG state is achieved around 573 K. In the phase diagramTndis the nanodomain starting temperature, andRsandMsare the martensitic transformation starting temperature for R and B19′ martensite, respectively,Tgis the STG transition temperature andTsis the spontaneous STG-R transition starting temperature46. These temperatures are determined by experiments shown in Extended Data Figs.8and9. The alloy shows a mono-crossover strain glass (MC-STG) transition whenTais much lower than 573 K and shows a conventional two-step martensitic transformation whenTais much higher than 573 K. MS-STG, mono-seed strain glass.

*** Figure5bexplains why the DS-STG state is obtained only when the step 2 annealing temperatureTais around 573 K. This is because the DS-STG’s forerunner state DC-STG is achieved only aroundTa≈ 573 K, as shown in the phase diagram (established from data from Fig.3band Extended Data Figs.8and9). WhenTadeviates significantly from 573 K, the forerunner DC-STG will no longer exist and consequently a R + B19′ DS-STG cannot be achieved after step 3 processing (that is, 12% elongation).

*** The phase diagram (Fig.5b) shows that a significantly lowerTa(for example,Ta≈ 473 K) will lead to a mono-crossover strain glass after step 2 processing, which is a R-STG that can cross over (partially) into one martensite B19′ at low temperature. After step 3 processing (12% elongation) it will change into a mono-seed strain glass (that is, with B19′ seeds only), which has a higher modulus of around 17 GPa (approximately 1.5 times higher than that of DS-STG) and a smaller recoverable strain of around 6%.

*** At a significantly higherTa≈ 773 K, which is a common annealing temperature for TiNi alloys26, the strain glass transition no longer exists, and the alloy is characterized by a normal two-step martensitic transformation into R and B19′ martensite. After step 3 processing (12% elongation) the alloy will change into an aligned B19′ martensite, which has an even higher modulus of around 30 GPa (ref.44) and an even smaller recoverable strain of around 4%. This is very different from the case of DS-STG, in which R and B19′ martensite seeds, albeit aligned, make up only a small volume fraction in the DC-STG matrix, as shown in Figs.3and4. On loading, these R and B19′ seeds in DS-STG grow into R and B19′ martensites at the expense of the matrix DC-STG at nearly zero stress owing to the absence of a nucleation barrier, thus resulting in ultralow Young’s modulus of around 10.5 GPa and an 8% recoverable strain, as observed in Fig.4.

*** The lower elastic modulus of the DS-STG state as compared with the non-DS-STG states can be explained by the phase instability of the system in the vicinity of the three different phases. This results in a nearly flat free-energy landscape, which facilitates the transition from one phase to another, and consequently the lattice becomes ultrasoft. Such an effect has been observed in many ferroelectrics and relaxor materials associated with multiple ferroelectric phases45.

*** It should be noted that the thermal stability of the ultralow modulus of the DS-STG alloy over a wide temperature range (Fig.2a) is a natural result of the DS-STG microstructure, in which R and B19′ martensite seeds can persist over a wide temperature range and they lead to the observed thermal stability of the ultralow modulus. The excellent fatigue resistance of the DS-STG alloy arises from the strengthening effect of the thermomechanical processing of the alloy that prohibits the motion and multiplication of dislocations; as a result, fatigue damage accumulation is significantly delayed or avoided.

*** A polymer-like ultrahigh-strength metal alloy DS-STG was fabricated by a simple three-step thermomechanical processing route. It has a combination of a polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus of around 10.5 GPa and a steel-like ultrahigh yield strength of around 1.3–1.8 GPa, together with a large pseudoelastic strain of approximately 8% and good temperature stability and excellent high-strain fatigue resistance. This unconventional alloy overcomes the long-standing strength–flexibility trade-off that has precluded such a long-sought-after property from being achieved. The ultralow elastic modulus originates from the unique DS-STG state that enables a nucleation-free reversible transition between strain glass and R and B19′ martensites, and the ultrahigh strength results from the deformation-strengthening effect. This polymer-like ultrahigh-strength alloy may open the door for a wide range of applications in emerging technologies such as morphing aerospace vehicles, superman-type humanoid robots and artificial organs. The industry-scalable fabrication route may enable mass production of such alloys.

*** Commercial Ti–50.8 at.%Ni alloy specimens from Xi’an Saite Co., Ltd and Beijing GEE SMA Technology Co., Ltd were used to fabricate all the samples. Two forms of the specimens were fabricated; one was a plate shape, which was spark-cut into a dog-bone shape with an initial gauge section dimension of 50 × 4.5 × 1 mm3, and the other was a wire shape with an initial diameter of 1 mm.

*** All samples were solution treated, followed by quenching in water. The plate samples were sealed in a vacuumized quartz tube and solution treated at 1,273 K for 90 min; the wire samples were solution treated in an automatic furnace kept at 1,023 K, which enabled the moving wires to enter and exit with a heating duration of 10 min before being quenched. After the solution treatment, the oxidation affected surface layer of all samples was removed by a chemical etchant.

*** Both plate and wire samples underwent similar three-step processing as described below and also shown in Fig.3a, with a difference only in the deformation mode in step 1. In step 1 processing, the plate samples were severely deformed by 50% cold elongation and the wire samples were severely deformed by 50% area reduction to a final approximately 0.7 mm diameter through cold-drawing. The severe deformation in step 1 changes the starting B2 phase into a metastable martensite microstructure stabilized by high-density dislocations.

*** In step 2 processing, the severely deformed samples were moderately annealed at 573 K for 10 min, followed by quenching in water. This process annihilates the metastable martensite formed during step 1 processing and yields a unique DC-STG state as described in the main text. It is noted that this 573 K annealing is important to produce the ultralow modulus after step 3 processing, and this is a lower annealing temperature than the conventional annealing temperatures of TiNi alloys, which are usually between 673 K and 773 K.

*** In step 3 processing, both the plate and wire samples after step 2 processing were moderately deformed at room temperature by a 12% elongation, which is slightly above the transformation strain of B19′ martensite (approximately 8–9%). This step creates a small fraction of R and B19′ martensite dual seeds out of the DC-STG matrix, and such a state is called ‘dual-seed strain glass’.

*** The stress–strain curves of all the samples were measured at room temperature with a Shimadzu AG-IS tensile machine operated at a strain rate of 2 × 10−3s−1. An extensometer (Epsilon Tech. 3442-006M-050M-LHT) was used to ensure accurate strain reading. Young’s modulus (E) was calculated from the initial slope of the stress–strain curves. The yield stress (σy) was determined to be the stress that produces 0.2% plastic deformation after unloading47. Recoverable strain (εre) was determined from the difference between the maximum and minimum strain shown in the unloading curve48.

*** The stress–strain curves of typical structural materials (shown in Fig.1b) were also tested using the same tensile machine for comparison with our DS-STG alloy of wire and plate shaped samples. These structural materials include metal alloys and organic-based materials: spring steel (65Mn), Ti alloy (Ti-6Al-4V ELI), Al alloy (7021-T62), Mg alloy (AZ91D), bamboo (dry), FRP (PPS GF40), PEEK and PPS. It is noted that the DS-STG wire sample had a higher yield strength (approximately 1.8 GPa) as compared with the DS-STG plate sample (approximately 1.3 GPa). This difference stems from the stronger work-hardening in the wire sample, because this sample (with 50% area reduction in step 1 processing) experienced stronger work-hardening than the plate sample (with 50% elongation, equivalent to a smaller area reduction of about 33%).

*** The temperature dependence of the mechanical properties was characterized by the same tensile machine (Shimadzu AG-IS) equipped with a temperature chamber (Shimadzu TCLN-220P). An extensometer (Epsilon Tech. 3442-006M-050M-LHT) was used to ensure accurate strain measurements. The stress–strain curves were the second cycle of a tensile test to 1.8 GPa.

*** The fatigue lifeNversus maximum cyclic stressσmcurve was measured using a fatigue testing machine (TA 3330 Series III) at room temperature in load-controlled tension–tension mode between 0 to the maximum stressσm. The testing frequency was 0.5–10 Hz. The corresponding maximum cyclic strainεmwas obtained from the experimental stress–strain relation at 20 °C (Fig.2a, upper-middle inset), except for the fatigue-free samples (with 5 × 106cycles), for which the strain εmwas directly measured using an extensometer during its first cycle and the runout cycle (Fig.2b, right inset).

*** Crystal structure characterization at different temperatures was carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-7000) equipped with a temperature sample holder. Cu Kα radiation was used as the incident X-ray source. In situ XRD under tensile deformation was performed with a self-made tension holder, which enabled in situ tension of a small XRD sample with a gauge dimension of 40 × 2 × 0.05 mm3.

*** Microscopic characterization was carried out with a JEM 2100 F TEM equipped with a field-emission gun and a cooling holder. The data were recorded using a GATAN CCD slow scan camera and analysed by DigitalMicrograph software. The TEM specimens were made by mechanical thinning down to about 0.1 mm followed by twin-jet polishing with a solution of 90% methanol and 10% sulfuric acid.

*** A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-Q200) from TA Instruments was used to monitor the occurrence of the martensitic transformation through monitoring its latent heat peak, and the heating–cooling rate was 10 K min−1. As a strain glass transition does not produce a significant differential scanning calorimeter peak, a dynamical mechanical analyser (DMA-Q850) from TA Instruments was used to monitor the key signature of a strain glass transition: a Vogel–Fulcher-type frequency-dependent anomaly in the storage modulus curve. The measurement was done in a single cantilever mode with an amplitude of 15 μm at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 Hz. The cooling–heating rate was 2 K min−1. Four-probe electrical resistivity measurements were used to monitor the R and B19′ martensitic transformation and strain glass transition under a constant current 100 mA and a cooling–heating rate of 2 K min−1.
