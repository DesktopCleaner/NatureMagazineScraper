*** Exploring new strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism but also for unlocking potential applications. A well-established concept uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties by modulating the carrier population in a capacitor structure1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that, in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers, the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt leads to a shift in the ferromagnetic resonance field depending on the microwave frequency when the Fe film is sufficiently thin. The experimental observation is interpreted as a current-induced modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ΔHAof Fe. We show that (1) ΔHAdecreases with increasing Fe film thickness and is connected to the damping-like torque; and (2) ΔHAdepends not only on the polarity of charge current but also on the magnetization direction, that is, ΔHAhas an opposite sign when the magnetization direction is reversed. The symmetry of the modification is consistent with a current-induced spin6,7,8and/or orbit9,10,11,12,13accumulation, which, respectively, act on the spin and/or orbit component of the magnetization. In this study, as Pt is regarded as a typical spin current source6,14, the spin current can play a dominant part. The control of magnetism by a spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin bands, providing functionality that was previously unknown and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices.

*** Spin torque (spin-transfer torque and spin–orbit torque), which involves the use of angular momentum generated by partially or purely spin-polarized currents, is a well-known means for manipulating the dynamic properties of magnetic materials. In structures such as giant magnetoresistance or tunnel magnetoresistance junctions, the flow of a spin-polarized electric current through the junction imparts spin-transfer torques on the magnetization in the free ferromagnetic layer15,16,17. In heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnet (FM) bilayers, a charge current flowing in HM induces a spin accumulation at the HM/FM interface and generates spin–orbit torques (SOTs) acting on FM18. These torques serve as versatile control mechanisms for magnetization dynamics, such as magnetization switching19,20, domain wall motion21,22,23, magnetization relaxation24and auto-oscillations of the magnetization25,26. These innovative approaches and their combinations open up a spectrum of possibilities for tailoring magnetic properties with potential implications for technologies such as magnetic random access memories18,27.

*** Although the impact of spin currents on the orientation of the magnetizationMis widely recognized, there have been only a few explicit observations of successful spin-current-driven manipulation of the magnitude ofM. Previous work28has shown that, in a magnetic Ni/Ru/Fe tri-layer in which the two magnetization layers are coupled by an exchange coupling, ultrafast laser-generated super-diffusive spin currents in Ni transiently enhance the magnetization of Fe when the two ferromagnetic layers are aligned parallel and decrease when the two ferromagnetic layers are aligned antiparallel, respectively. This transient effect is limited to low optical excitations because super-diffusive spin currents saturate at high power. To explore the modulation of magnetism by spin current, Fig.1shows the process of spin current transfer15,16,17,29,30,31. Spin accumulation, generated by a charge currentI, contains both transverse and longitudinal spin components with respect toM. It can be generated by the strong spin splitting of the energy band of ferromagnetic metals17, by spin Hall effect6, by orbital Hall effect and by subsequent conversion of the orbital current into a spin current by the spin–orbit interaction in the bulk7as well as by spin Rashba–Edelstein effect (alternatively named inverse spin galvanic effect)8at the interfaces. The incident transverse spin current dephases and is absorbed byM, which gives rise to damping-like spin torques and is responsible for the change inMdirection29,30. After spin transfer and in the spin diffusion length of FM, the exiting spin current is on average aligned withM, and the spin-up electron can fill the majority band whenMis along the +zdirection (Fig.1a). Owing to the enhanced exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin bands, this leads to an enhancement ofMas well as an increase in the magnetic anisotropies. WhenMis along the −zdirection as shown in Fig.1b, a decrease inMis expected because of the filling of the minority band and the reduction of the exchange splitting. Similarly, once the polarity of the spin current is reversed by reversing the polarity ofI, a decrease or an increase inMis expected ifM∥+zorM∥−z, respectively, as shown in Fig.1c,d. Therefore, the change in magnetization ΔMby a spin current is expected to be odd with respect to the inversion of eitherIorM, that is, ΔM(I,M) = −ΔM(−I,M) = −ΔM(I, −M).

*** a, The electron spins transmitted into the FM contain both transverse and longitudinal components with respect toM. Owing to exchange coupling, the transverse component dephases and is absorbed byM, which gives rise to the damping-like (DL) SOT and is responsible for changing the direction ofM. The longitudinal component of the spin current is on average aligned withM, leading to additional filling of the majority band whenMis oriented along the +zdirection, and an enhancement of the magnitudeMas well as an increase in magnetic anisotropies are expected because of the enhanced exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin energy bands.b, WhenMis aligned along the –zdirection, the spin-polarized electron enters the minority band, which can lead to a decrease inMas well as a decrease in the magnetic anisotropies because of the reduction in the exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin energy bands.c,d, The same asaandbbut the polarization of the spin current is reversed, which is expected to reduceMforM∥+z(c) and enhanceMforM∥−z(d).

*** To prove the above scenario, Pt (6 nm)/Al (1.5 nm)/Fe (tFe= 4.5, 2.8, 2.2 and 1.2 nm) multilayers with different Fe thicknessestFeare grown on a single 2-inch semi-insulating GaAs(001) wafer by molecular-beam epitaxy (Fig.2b,Methodsand Supplementary Note1). The ultrathin Fe films on GaAs(001) allow us to investigate the expected modification of the magnetic properties for two reasons: Fe/GaAs(001) shows (1) very low Gilbert dampingαvalues in the sub-nanometre thickness regime (α= 0.0076 fortFe= 0.91 nm) (ref.32), and thus it is possible to detect the magnetization dynamics for ultrathin samples and (2) strong interfacial in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which is advantageous for the detection of the spin-current-induced modification of magnetic anisotropies. The UMA originates from the anisotropic bonding between Fe and As atoms at the GaAs(001) surface33, in which the⟨110⟩orientations are the magnetic easy axis (EA) and the\(\langle \bar{1}10\rangle \)orientations are the magnetic hard axis (HA) (Fig.2c). We perform time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy measurements with out-of-plane driving field to characterize both the static and dynamic magnetic properties of Fe under the influence of spin currents generated by applying a charge current in Pt (Fig.2aandMethods).

A detailed measurement of d(ΔH)/dIas a function ofφI–Hshows that d(ΔH)/dIvaries strongly around HA. The angular dependence can be well fitted by considering an effective damping-like SOT efficiencyξof 0.06 (Methods). The weaker damping-like torque, generated by the Bychkov–Rashba-like and Dresselhaus-like spin–orbit interactions at the Fe/GaAs interface, plays a negligible part in the linewidth modulation34. As the angular dependence of d(ΔH)/dIcan be well fitted by conventional SOTs18,35, that is, equation (10) inMethods, there is no need to consider other higher order SOTs36.

*** Having identified the modification of ΔH, we now focus on the modification ofHR, which is related to the magnetization and magnetic anisotropies. Figure3a,bshows theIdependence ofHRfortFe= 2.8 nm measured at selected frequenciesfforHapplied along EA and HA to avoid magnetic dragging effects32,34. As shown at the top of each panel, the current is applied along the [100] orientation, and the direction of spinσis along the [010] orientation with equal projections onto the [110] and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations. Therefore, this geometry allows a precise comparison of the current-induced modification ofHRbetween the [110] and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations in the same device. ForM∥[110] (Fig.3a), all theHR–Itraces show a positive curvature, whereas forM∥\([\bar{1}10]\)(Fig.3b), traces with a negative curvature are observed. The positive and negative curvatures along [110] and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations are because Joule heating reduces the magnetization and thus the UMA, resulting in an increase inHRalong [110] but a decrease inHRalong\([\bar{1}10]\). Apart from the symmetric parabolic dependence induced by Joule heating, a linear component in theIdependence ofHRis also observed becauseHR(−I) ≠HR(+I) holds. Note that forMalong both EA and HA,HR(−I) >HR(+I) holds for all frequencies. AstFeis reduced to 1.2 nm, theIdependence ofHRalong the EA is similar to the one withtFe= 2.8 nm andHR(−I) >HR(+I) still holds (Fig.3c). However, forM∥\([\bar{1}10]\)(Fig.3d), the relative magnitude ofHR(−I) andHR(+I) strongly depends onf, that is,HR(−I) <HR(+I) holds forf= 12.0 GHz;HR(−I) ≈HR(+I) holds forf= 14.0 GHz butHR(−I) >HR(+I) holds forf= 16.0 GHz. The frequency-dependent shift ofHRindicates that the magnetic properties of Fe are modified by the spin current for thinner samples, an observation that has not been reported before, to our knowledge.

As shown in the top panels, for all the devices, the charge currents are applied along the [100] orientation, and the direction of the spin accumulationσis along the [010] direction with equal projections onto the [110] and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations. This experimental trick allows an accurate comparison of the current-induced modification for the [110] and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations in the same device.

Thefdependences of dHR/dIfor different orientations ofMand differenttFeare summarized in Fig.4. FortFe= 2.8 nm andM∥⟨110⟩orientations (Fig.4a), dHR/dIis independent of frequency with a positive zero-frequency intercept (about 0.08 mT mA−1) forM∥\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\). AsMis rotated by 180° to the [110] orientation, the sign of the intercept changes to negative with the same amplitude as the\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)orientation (around −0.08 mT mA−1). This can be understood in terms of the current-induced Oersted field and/or field-like torquehOe/FL, arising from the current flowing in Pt and Al, which shiftsHR. The field-like torque originates from the incomplete dephasing (non-transmitted and/or non-dephased) component of the incoming spin29,30,37. ForMalong HA (Fig.4b), thef-independent dHR/dIhas also opposite zero-frequency intercepts forM∥\([\bar{1}10]\)andM∥\([1\bar{1}0]\)with virtually identicalhOe/FLvalue as EA. This confirms that the spin accumulationσhas equal projection onto the⟨110⟩and\(\langle \bar{1}10\rangle \)orientations. AstFeis reduced to 1.2 nm (Fig.4c), the intercept of thef-independent dHR/dItraces along [110] and\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)orientations, respectively, increases to about −0.20 mT mA−1and about 0.20 mT mA−1, respectively. However, asMis aligned along HA (Fig.4d), the dHR/dItrace differs significantly from other traces: (1) it is no longerfindependent but shows a linear dependence onfwith opposite slopes forMalong the\([\bar{1}10]\)and\([1\bar{1}0]\)orientations, (2) the absolute value of the zero-frequency intercept along HA (about 0.32 mT mA−1) is no longer equal to that along EA (about 0.2 mT mA−1). Thefdependence of the dHR/dItraces cannot be interpreted to arise from the frequency-independenthOe/FLand can be explained only by a change in the magnetic anisotropies induced by the spin current.

The magnitude ofHK,HUandHBatI= 0 for eachtFeis quantified by the angle and frequency dependencies ofHR(Methods). Obviously, a change in the magnetic anisotropy fieldsHA(HA=HK,HU,HB) by ΔHA(ΔHA= ΔHK, ΔHU, ΔHB) leads to a shift ofHRand the magnitude of the shift ΔHR, defined as ΔHR=HR(HA) −HR(HA+ ΔHA), depends onf.

As thefdependence of\(\Delta {H}_{\text{R}}^{\text{EA}}\)induced by ΔHUhas an opposite slope as those induced by ΔHKand ΔHB(Methods), it is possible to obtain anf-independent\(\Delta {H}_{\text{R}}^{\text{EA}}\)along EA by tuning the corresponding parameters and to obtain anf-linear\(\Delta {H}_{{\rm{R}}}^{{\rm{HA}}}\)along HA. To reproduce the results along the [110] and\([1\bar{1}0]\)orientations (that is, the net magnetization of these two orientations is parallel toI), we obtain ΔHB= 0.26 mT mA−1, ΔHK= 2.0 mT mA−1and ΔHU= 2.5 mT mA−1through equations (3) and (4) (Methods). By contrast, for the datasets forMalong the\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)and\([\bar{1}10]\)orientations (that is, the magnetization is rotated by 180° and the net magnetization is antiparallel toI), ΔHB= −0.26 mT mA−1, ΔHK= −2.0 mT mA−1and ΔHU= −2.5 mT mA−1are obtained, which have the opposite polarity compared with that ofMalong the [110] and\([1\bar{1}0]\)orientations.

*** Figure4eshows the obtained ΔHAas a function oftFe. FortFeabove 2.8 nm, the modification of the magnetic anisotropy is too small to be observed. FortFebelow 2.2 nm, ΔHAincreases astFedecreases. This indicates that the spin-current-induced modification of the magnetic energy landscape is of interfacial origin, similar to the damping-like spin torque determined by thefdependence of d(ΔH)/dI(Methods), and a possible magnetic proximity effect has no role in the modification (Supplementary Note3). The modification changes sign whenMis rotated by 180°, which fully validates the scenario of ΔHA(I,M) = −ΔHA(−I,M) = −ΔHA(I, −M) as suggested in Fig.1. For a givenMdirection, the obtained ΔHB, ΔHKand ΔHUhave the same sign, which is also consistent with a monotonic increase or decrease inHB,HKandHUas temperature decreases or increases, respectively (Supplementary Fig.7). Moreover, these results also show thatHUis more sensitive to spin current thanHKandHB,highlighting the importance of UMA to enable the observation. The much smaller ΔHBvalue is becauseHBis one to two orders of magnitude smaller thanHUandHKin the ultrathin regime (Methods). It should be noted that, besides the modification of anisotropy, an anisotropic modification ofγcould, in principle, explain the experimental results according to equation (3). However, as it is not clear why a modification ofgcould be anisotropic, we ignore this effect here (Methods).

*** AsHK≈Mholds in the ultrathin regime (Methods), ΔHKis directly related to ΔM. The change in magnetization can be attributed to the additional filling of the electronicd-band. To a first-order approximation, the filling of thed-band by spin current leads to a change in the magnetic moment of the order ofns/nFe≈ 0.16%, wherensis the transferred areal spin density, andnFeis the areal density of the magnetic moment of Fe. This estimation agrees with the ratio between ΔHKandHK, that is, ΔHK/HK≈ 0.2% (Methods).

*** By contrast, to mimic the effect of spin current on the UMA and magnetic moment, we have investigated the dependence of the UMA on the external magnetic field by first-principles electronic band structure calculations. The resulting modification of UMA has been determined using magnetic torque calculations38(Supplementary Note4). The appliedHresults in an increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy, ifHis parallel toMand to a decrease in anisotropy in the case of antiparallel orientation. These changes are accompanied by an increase (forH> 0) or decrease (forH< 0) of magnetic moment, consistent with experimental observations. Moreover, to model a change in ΔHUof 2.5 mT for a d.c. current of 1 mA as observed in the experiment, an equivalent magnetic field of about 1.5 T is needed (Supplementary Note4). More sophisticated models might be needed to extend the existing model and to explain the experimental results quantitatively.

*** Our results have shown that the intrinsic properties of ultrathin ferromagnetic materials, that is, the magnitude ofMandHA, can be varied in a controlled way by spin currents, which has been ignored in the spin-transfer physics. This unique route of controlling magnetic anisotropies is not accessible by other existing ways using electric field1,2,3,4,5and mechanical stress39,40in which the control of magnetism is independent of the magnetization direction. Besides the magnitude of the magnetization, other material parameters, such as the Curie temperature and coercive, are also expected to be controllable by spin current. Spin torque plays an essential part in modern spintronic devices; thus, beyond this proof of principle, the so far unnoticed modification of the length ofMby spin currents could offer an alternative and attractive generic actuation mechanism for the spin-torque phenomena. We expect such a modification of the magnetic energy landscape to be a general feature, not limited to ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal systems with strong spin–orbit interaction but also to be present in the case of conventional spin-transfer torques, in which it is generally believed that the magnitude ofMis fixed during the spin-transfer process15,16,17. Although the modulation of magnetism is demonstrated by using a single-crystalline ferromagnet, this concept also applies to polycrystalline ferromagnets, for example, Py. Moreover, the modification is not limited to in-plane ferromagnets, and we could manipulate ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy by using out-of-plane polarized spin current sources, for example, WTe2(ref.41), RuO2(refs.42,43,44,45), Mn3Sn (ref.46) and Mn3Ga (ref.47). We believe that much larger modification amplitudes can be realized in other more effective spin current sources based on the wide range of spin-torque material choices18.

*** Apart from the spin effect mentioned above, recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the orbital Hall effect9and the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect10,11,12can generate orbital angular momenta in the bulk of nonmagnetic layers and at interfaces with broken inversion symmetry. The generated orbital momenta can exert a torque onMand could also cause a modification ofMin two ways: (1) the orbital current diffuses into an adjacent magnetic layer and is converted into a spin current by spin–orbit interaction13,14. In this case, the modification ofMis analogous to the scenario discussed for a spin current. (2) The orbital current could, in principle, act directly on the orbital part ofM, generating orbital torques as well as leading to a modification of the orbital magnetization. The change inMby an orbital current is expected to have the same odd symmetry as that induced by a spin current. Importantly, orbital effects could induce an even larger modification than spin effects because of the giant orbital Hall conductivity9observed in some materials and could affect thicker ferromagnets as it has been predicted that the orbital current dephasing length is longer than the spin dephasing length48.

*** Samples with various Fe thicknessestFeare grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). First, a GaAs buffer layer of 100 nm is grown in a III–V MBE. After that the substrate (semi-insulating wafer, which has a resistivityρbetween 1.72 × 108Ω cm and 2.16 × 108Ω cm) is transferred to a metal MBE without breaking the vacuum for the growth of the metal layers. For a better comparison of the physical properties of different samples, various Fe thicknesses are grown on a single two-inch wafer by stepping the main shadow shutter of the metal MBE. After the growth of the step-wedged Fe film, 1.5-nm Al/6-nm Pt layers are deposited on the whole wafer. Sharp reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns have been observed after the growth of each layer (Supplementary Note1), which indicate the epitaxial growth mode as well as good surface (interface) flatness. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements (Supplementary Note1) show that (1) all the layers are crystalline and (2) there is diffusion of Al into Pt but no significant Al–Fe and Pt–Fe interdiffusion. Therefore, the magnetic proximity effect between Fe and Pt is reduced. The intermixed Pt–Al alloy can be a good spin current generator. Previous work49has shown that alloying Pt with Al enhances the spin-torque efficiency.

*** First, Pt/Al/Fe stripes with a dimension of 4 μm × 20 μm and with the long side along the [110] and [100] orientations are defined by a mask-free writer and Ar-etching. After that, contact pads for the application of the d.c. current, which are made from 3-nm Ti and 50 nm Au, are prepared by evaporation and lift-off. Then, a 70-nm Al2O3layer is deposited by atomic layer deposition to electrically isolate the d.c. contacts and the coplanar waveguide (CPW). Finally, the CPW consisting of 5 nm Ti and 150 nm Au is fabricated by evaporation, and the Fe/Al/Pt stripes are located in the gap between the signal line and ground line of the CPW (Fig.2a). During the fabrication, the highest baking temperature is 110 °C. The CPW is designed to match the radiofrequency network that has an impedance of 50 Ω. The width of the signal line and the gap are 50 μm and 30 μm, respectively. Magnetization dynamics of Fe are excited by out-of-plane Oersted field induced by the radiofrequency microwave currents flowing in the signal and ground lines.

*** The FMR method is used in this study for several reasons: (1) FMR has a higher sensitivity than static magnetization measurements. (2) The FMR method, together with angle and frequency-dependent measurements, is a standard way to quantify the effective magnetization, magnetic anisotropies and Gilbert damping. (3) Damping-like and field-like torques can be determined simultaneously in a single experiment, and thus we can establish a connection between damping-like torque and the modification of magnetic anisotropies. (4) The Joule heating effect, which also alters the magnetic properties of Fe, can be easily excluded from theIdependence ofHR.

*** The FMR spectra are measured optically by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy; a pulse train of a Ti:sapphire laser (repetition rate of 80 MHz and pulse width of 150 fs) with a wavelength of 800 nm is phase-locked to a microwave current. A phase shifter is used to adjust the phase between the laser pulse train and microwave, and the phase is kept constant during the measurement. The polar Kerr signal at a certain phase,VKerr, is detected by a lock-in amplifier by phase modulating the microwave current at a frequency of 6.6 kHz. TheVKerrsignal is measured by sweeping the external magnetic field, and the magnetic field can be rotated in-plane by 360°. A Keithley 2400 device is used as the d.c. current source for linewidth and resonance field modifications. All measurements are performed at room temperature.

*** The FMR spectra are well fitted by combining a symmetric (Lsym= ΔH2/[4(H−HR)2+ ΔH2]) and an anti-symmetric Lorentzian (La-sym= −4ΔH(H−HR)/[4(H−HR)2+ ΔH2]),VKerr=VsymLsym+Va-symLa-sym+Voffset, whereHRis the resonance field, ΔHis the full width at half maximum,Voffsetis the offset voltage, andVsym(Va-sym) is the magnitude of the symmetric (anti-symmetric) component ofVKerr. It is worth mentioning that, by analysing the position ofHR, we have also confirmed that the application of the charge currents does not have a detrimental effect on the magnetic properties of the Fe films (Supplementary Note2).

The results show that the Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs samples have virtually identical magnetic anisotropies as the AlOx/Fe/GaAs samples, and introducing the Pt/Al layer neither enhances the magnetization leading to an increase inHKnor generates a perpendicular anisotropy leading to a decrease inHK. By comparing the values ofHKandM, we confirm that the main contribution toHKstems from the magnetization due to the demagnetization field. For both sample series,HKandHBdecrease astFedecreases because of the reduction of the magnetization astFedecreases, and both of them scale linearly with\({t}_{\text{Fe}}^{{-}1}\). The intercept (about 2,220 mT) of the\({H}_{{\rm{K}}}-{t}_{\text{Fe}}^{-1}\)trace corresponds to the saturation magnetization of bulk Fe, and the intercept (around 45 mT) of the\({H}_{{\rm{B}}}-{t}_{\text{Fe}}^{-1}\)trace corresponds to the biaxial anisotropy of bulk Fe. In contrast toHKandHB,HUshows a linear dependence on\({t}_{\text{Fe}}^{{-}1}\)with a zero intercept, indicative of the interfacial origin ofHU.

*** Extended Data Fig.3a,bshows theφHdependence andfdependence, respectively, of linewidth ΔHfortFe= 1.2 nm. The magnitude of ΔHvaries strongly withφHbecause of the presence of in-plane anisotropy, and the dependencies of ΔHonfalong both EA and HA show linear behaviour. Both the angular and frequency dependence of ΔHcan be well fitted by51

*** where Δ[Im(χ)] is the linewidth of the imaginary part of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility Im(χ),H1andH2are defined in equation (5) for arbitraryHvalues, and ΔH0is the residual linewidth (zero-frequency intercept). As the angular trace can be well fitted by using a damping value of 0.0078, there is no need to consider other extrinsic effects (that is, inhomogeneity and/or two-magnon scattering) contributing to ΔH. It is worth mentioning that the angular trace gives a slightly higherαvalue because ΔH0, which also depends onφH, is not considered in the fit. In this case, the frequency dependence of linewidth gives more reliable damping values (Extended Data Fig.3b). Extended Data Fig.3ccompares the magnitude of damping for Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs and AlOx/Fe/GaAs samples. For both sample series, the Gilbert damping increases astFedecreases and a linear dependence ofαon\({t}_{\text{Fe}}^{{-}1}\)is observed. The enhancement ofαis because of the spin pumping effect, which is given by52,53

*** whereα0is the intrinsic damping of pure bulk Fe and\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)is the effective spin mixing conductance quantifying the spin pumping efficiency. By usingμ0M= 2.2 T andγ= 1.80 × 1011rad s−1T−1, the magnitude of\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)for Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs is determined to be 4.6 × 1018m−2, and\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)at the Fe/GaAs interface is determined to be 1.9 × 1018m−2. Therefore, by subtracting these two values, the magnitude of\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)at Pt/Al/Fe interface is determined to be 2.7 × 1018m−2. The spin transparencyTintof the Pt/Al/Fe interface is given by ref.53

*** where 2e2/his the conductance quantum,GPt[= 1/(ρxxλs)] is the spin conductance of Pt,ρxxis the resistivity andλsis the spin diffusion length. By usingλs= 4 nm and an averagedρxx= 40 μΩ cm,Tint= 0.21 is determined. We note that the magnitude of\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)at the Pt/Al/Fe interface is about one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental values found at heavy metal/ultrathin ferromagnet interfaces54, but very close to the value obtained by the first-principles calculations55. The previously overestimated\({g}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{\uparrow \downarrow }\)and thusTintat heavy metal/ultrathin ferromagnet interfaces is probably because the enhancement ofαby two-magnon scattering56as well as by the magnetic proximity effect (see Supplementary Note3) is not properly excluded. Moreover, the obtainedα0values for Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs (α0= 0.0039) and AlOx/Fe/GaAs (α0= 0.0033) slightly differ; the reason is unclear to us, but might be because of a small error in the Fe thickness, which is hard to be determined accurately in the ultrathin regime.

*** To model the modulation of the FMR linewidth by the application of d.c. current, the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation with damping-like spin-torque term is considered18,35,

*** Having obtained the linewidth forI= 0, the next step is to calculate the influence of the linewidth by spin–orbit torque. The magnitude ofhDLis given by

Plugging equations (17) and (18) into equations (13) and (14), theIdependence of ΔHcan be obtained. An example is shown in Extended Data Fig.4c, which shows a linear ΔH−Irelationship. From the linear fit (equation (1) in the main text), we obtain the modulation amplitude of ΔH, that is,d(ΔH)/dI. Extended Data Fig.4dpresents the calculatedd(ΔH)/dIas a function of the magnetic field angle, which shows a strong variation around the HA.

*** To reproduce the experimental data as shown in Fig.1fin the main text, the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropies and the damping parameter obtained in Extended Data Fig.3as well asξ= 0.06 are used. Note that the distinctive presence of robust UMA at the Fe/GaAs interface significantly alters the angular dependence ofd(ΔH)/dI. This deviation is remarkable when compared with the sinφI–Hdependence ofd(ΔH)/dIas observed in polycrystalline samples, such as Pt/Py (refs.57,58).

*** To understand the strong deviation ofd(ΔH)/dIaround the HA, we plot the in-plane angular dependence ofFin Extended Data Fig.5forθ=θH= 90°, that is,

*** It shows that, around the HA (approximately ±15°), the magnetic potential barrier completely vanishes and\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \varphi }=0\)and\(\frac{{\partial }^{2}F}{\partial \varphi } < 0\)hold. This indicates that the net static torques induced by internal and external magnetic fields acting on the magnetization cancel and the magnetization has a large cone angle for precession59. Consequently, the magnetization behaves freely with no constraints in the vicinity of the HA, and the low stiffness allows largerd(ΔH)/dIvalues induced by spin current60. If there are no in-plane magnetic anisotropies, the free energy is constant and is independent of the angle, the magnetization always follows the direction of the applied magnetic field and has the same stiffness at each position. Therefore, the modulation shows no deviation around the HA.

*** Extended Data Fig.6ashows the frequency dependence of the modulation of linewidth d(ΔH)/dIfortFe= 2.8 nm and 1.2 nm, in which the current flows along the [100] orientation. For both samples, the modulation changes polarity as the direction ofMis changed by 180°. The modulation amplitude increases quasi-linearly with frequency, and the experimental results can be also reproduced by equation (14) usingξ= 0.06, consistent with the angular modulation shown in Fig.2f. ForHalong the⟨110⟩and\(\langle \bar{1}10\rangle \)orientations, the frequency and the Fe thickness dependence of linewidth modulation is approximately given by24

*** whereφI–H= 45°, 135°, 225° and 315° as shown by the inset of each panel in Extended Data Fig.6. The damping-like torque efficiency can be further quantified by the slopesoff-dependence modulation, that is,\(s=\frac{\text{d}[\text{d}(\Delta H)\,/\,\text{d}I]}{\text{d}f}\). Extended Data Fig.7shows the absolute value ofsvalues as a function of\({t}_{\text{Fe}}^{{-}1}\). A linear dependence of |s| on\({t}_{\text{Fe}}^{{-}1}\)is observed, which indicates that the damping-like torque is an interfacial effect, originating from the absorption of spin current generated in Pt (ref.61).

*** In this section, we show our procedure to quantify the modulation of magnetic anisotropies by spin currents. According to equation (5), thefdependencies ofHRalong the EA (φH=φ= 45° and 225°) and the HA (φH=φ= 135° and 315°) are given by equation (3). From the angle and frequency dependencies ofHRas shown in Extended Data Fig.2,μ0HK= 1,350 mT,μ0HU= 128 mT,μ0HB= 10 mT andg= 2.05 are determined fortFe= 1.2 nm. Extended Data Fig.8ashows theHRdependence offforμ0HK= 1,350 mT (blue solid line) andμ0HK+ Δμ0HK= 1,400 mT (red solid line) along the HA calculated by equation (3). To exaggerate the difference,μ0ΔHKof 50 mT is assumed. The shift of the resonance field ΔHRis obtained as ΔHR=HR(HK) −HR(HK+ ΔHK), and the frequency dependence of ΔHRis plotted in Extended Data Fig.8b, which shows a linear behaviour with respect tofbetween 10 GHz and 20 GHz (in the experimental range), that is, ΔHR=kKf. Note that, to simplify the analysis, the zero-frequency intercept is ignored because the magnitude is much smaller than the intercept induced by ΔHUand ΔHB. The sign of the slopekKis the same as that of ΔHKand its magnitude is proportional to ΔHK, that is,kK∝ΔHK. For the EA as shown in Extended Data Fig.8c,d, the ΔHR–frelationship induced by ΔHKremains the same as for the HA, that is, ΔHR=kKfstill holds.

*** Extended Data Fig.8eshows theHRdependence offforμ0HU= 128 mT (blue solid line) andμ0HU+μ0ΔHU= 178 mT (red solid line) along the HA. As shown in Extended Data Fig.8f, the shift of the resonance field along the HA is independent offwith a negative intercept, that is, ΔHR=−ΔHU. However, for the EA, as shown in Extended Data Fig.8g,h, thef-dependent ΔHRcan be expressed as ΔHR= ΔHU−kUf, which has an opposite slope compared with the ΔHR–frelationships induced by ∆HK(Extended Data Fig.8d), that is,kU∝−ΔHU.

*** If the modulation is induced by a change in the biaxial anisotropy as shown in Extended Data Fig.8i–l, ΔHRalong both the HA and EA shows a linear dependence onf, which is expressed as ΔHR= −ΔHB+kBf, andkB∝ΔHBholds.

*** Extended Data Table1summarizes the ΔHR–frelationships both along the EA and HA induced by ΔHK, ΔHUand ΔHB.

*** AshOe/FLgenerated by the d.c. current also shifts the resonance field along the EA and HA axes by\(\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}{h}_{\text{Oe}/\text{FL}}\), where plus corresponds to the [110] (EA) and the\([\bar{1}10]\)(HA) directions, and minus corresponds to the\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)(EA) and the\([1\bar{1}0]\)(HA) directions, the total ΔHRinduced by ΔHK, ΔHUand ΔHBalong the EA and HA is, respectively, given by equation (4).

*** Based on equations (4) and (5), the values of ΔHK,ΔHU, ΔHBandhOe/FLfortFe≤ 2.2 nm are extracted as follows:

*** We consider the results obtained forH∥M∥[110] (EA) andH∥M/\([1\bar{1}0]\)(HA) as shown in Extended Data Fig.9a(the same results as shown in Fig.4in the main text forI= 1 mA), where the net magnetization is parallel toI. Atf= 0, equation (4) is reduced to

*** By adding equations (21) and (22), the magnitude of ΔHBis determined to be 0.26 mT, which corresponds tokBof 4 × 10−3mT GHz−1according to equation (3).

*** From Extended Data Fig.9a, the slope along the HA is determined to bekK+kB= 0.025 mT GHz−1. Thus, the magnitude ofkKis determined bykK= 0.025 mT GHz−1−kB= 0.021 mT GHz−1, which corresponds to ΔHK= 2.0 mT according to equation (3).

*** As\(\Delta {H}_{\text{R}}^{\text{EA}}\)is frequency independent, this requires thatkU=kK+kB= 0.025 mT GHz−1, which corresponds ΔHU= 2.5 mT.

*** As the magnetization along EA and HA is, respectively, rotated by 180° to the\([\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)and\([\bar{1}10]\)directions, and the net magnetization is antiparallel toI(Extended Data Fig.9b), we obtain ΔHB= −0.26 mT, ΔHK= −2.0 mT and ΔHU= −2.5 mT, which are of opposite sign as the results obtained from Extended Data Fig.9a.

*** Finally, bringing the magnitude of ΔHBand ΔHUback into equations (21) and (22),\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}{h}_{\text{Oe}/\text{FL}}\)is determined to be −2.24 mT. The negative sign ofhOe/FLindicates that it is along the\([0\bar{1}0]\)orientation.

*** Similarly, the corresponding ΔHB, ΔHKand ΔHUvalues can be determined fortFe= 2.2 nm (Extended Data Fig.10). Extended Data Table2summarizes the magnitudes of the magnetic anisotropy modifications as well as thehOe/FLvalues for all the devices. The enhancement of the field-like torque in thinner samples has been observed in other systems and is probably because of the enhanced Bychkov–Rashba spin–orbit interaction61,62and/or the orbital angular momentum (orbital Hall effect and orbital Rashba effect) at the ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal interface62.

*** It is worth mentioning that, once the magnetization direction is fixed, ΔHB, ΔHKand ΔHUobtained either from Extended Data Fig.9a(Extended Data Fig.10a) or from Extended Data Fig.9b(Extended Data Fig.10b) have the same sign (either positive or negative depending on the direction ofM). This is consistent with the change in magnetic anisotropies by temperature (Supplementary Fig.7), which shows that the magnitude of ΔHB,HKand ΔHUincreases as the temperature decreases and decreases as the temperature increases. This indicates that the increase in the magnetic anisotropies is dominated by the increase inMas temperature decreases and the decrease in the magnetic anisotropies is dominated by the decrease inMas temperature increases. For the spin current modification demonstrated here, the temperature is not changed but the change inMis induced by populating the electronic bands by the spin current. More interestingly, the new modification method can control the increase or decrease inMsimply by the direction of current and/or the direction of magnetization, which is not accessible by other controls.

*** It is known that the starting point of the FMR analysis is the static magnetic energy landscape, which is related to the magnetic anisotropies. Therefore, it is natural to consider that the modification of magnetic anisotropy accounts for thef-linear dHR/dIcurves as observed in the experiment. Although the data analysis discussed in the previous section is self-consistent, there could be alternative interpretations of the data. One possibility could be the current-induced modification of the Landég-factor of Fe. In magnetic materials, it is known thatgis related to the orbital momentμLand the spin momentμS:

*** A flow of spin and orbital angular momentum induced by charge current could, respectively, modify the orbital and spin moment of Fe by ΔμSand ΔμL, and then a change in the gyromagnetic ratio of Fe is expected. This could, in turn, lead to a shift of FMR resonance fields linearly depending on the frequency. However, if this were the case, an anisotropic modification ofgis needed to interpret the data as observed in Extended Data Figs.9and10(that is, there is sizeable modification along the HA, but no modification along the EA). As we cannot figure out why the modification ofgcould be anisotropic, we ignore the discussion of theg-factor modification in the main text. We are also open to other possible explanations for the experimental observations.

*** The change in magnetization is attributed to the additional filling of the electronicd-band. The induced filling of the bands in Fe occurs mainly close to the interface and is not homogeneously distributed, as it depends on the spin diffusion length of the spin current in Fe. In other words, the measured modulated magnetic anisotropies are averaged over the whole ferromagnetic film. For simplicity, we neglect the spin current distribution in Fe and assume that it is homogeneously distributed. The spin chemical potential at the interface63is given by\({u}_{\text{s}}^{0}=2e\lambda \xi E\tanh \left(\frac{{t}_{\text{Pt}}}{2\lambda }\right)\), whereeis the elementary charge,λis the spin diffusion length,E(=j/σ) is the electric field,jis the current density andσis the conductivity of Pt. The areal spin densitynstransferred into Fe is obtained as\({n}_{\text{s}}={u}_{\text{s}}^{0}\lambda N\)(ref.18), whereNis the density of states at the Fermi level. UsingN= 6 × 1048J−1m−3,λ= 4 nm,ξ= 0.06,σ= 2.0 × 106Ω−1m−1,ns= 4.2 × 1012μBcm−2is obtained forI= 1 mA. As Fe has a bcc structure (lattice constanta= 2.8 Å) with a moment of about 1.0 μBfortFe= 1.2 nm at room temperature64, the areal density of the magnetic moment of FenFeis determined to be 2.6 × 1014μBcm−2. In this case, the filling of thed-band by spin current leads to a change in the magnetic moment of the order ofns/nFe≈ 0.16%, which agrees with the ratio between ΔHKandHK, that is, ΔHK/HK≈ 2.0 mT/ 1 T ≈ 0.2%.
